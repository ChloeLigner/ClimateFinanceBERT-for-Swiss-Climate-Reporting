Vocational training for 40.000 people. 50% of whom are women by 2017. improves the quality of works and increases the competitiveness of companies by contributing to the increase in income in the priority regions of the SDC and Danish cooperation.  ,In Mali. training offers are not adapted to the needs of the labor market. The workforce of a population estimated at 15.97 million in 2013 lacks qualifications and the products of the education/training system do not correspond to the demand of employers. However. the vast majority of workers in Mali are young. rural and illiterate with a median age of 14 years. This workforce lacking qualifications cannot therefore contribute sufficiently to the competitiveness of companies and therefore to economic growth. The works carried out do not always meet the required standards and the finishes on these achievements do not satisfy the applicants. The agricultural sector. which provides a living for 80% of the population with a contribution to the GDP of 41%. is not sufficiently taken into account by most training programs.

More than 95% of the 8.180 young people trained are employed; 1.717 people. including 25% women. have carried out economic projects; Program. phase 5 to 6: The decentralization of vocational training is now an achievement through the support of political dialogue in Switzerland: local authorities ensure project management; Lessons: The involvement of the private sector in the planning and implementation of vocational training is essential to guarantee the necessary responsiveness expected by public authorities; The strengthening of regional and local authorities is important for the scaling up of good practices and successful experiences; To have a better impact on local and regional development. it is necessary to avoid isolated actions because Vocational Training - Employment requires significant resources and no partner can do it alone. So. pooling resources from TFPs. the private sector and the government becomes a guarantee of efficiency; Vocational training is still poorly regarded in many circles in Mali. it appears as the last chance solution for the disadvantaged and excluded from school to be able to exercise a &quot;small&quot; job., Trained people enter or re-enter employment; Private and public stakeholders in Vocational Training for Employment develop and implement diversified training. adapted to market opportunities and needs.

Bolivia remains among the poorest and most unequal countries in Latin America. Poverty incidence is 64% in rural areas and 41% in urban areas. Rural areas depend mainly on agriculture as livelihood basis. In order to generate additional income and reach food security. the poor in rural areas need to improve crop productivity and diversify production. To achieve this.

Children and women are disproportionately affected. Conflicts. violent extremism. the proliferation of arms. mass displacements and the resulting erosion of the rule of law are on the rise. One in six children was living in a conflict zone in 2020. That amounts to approximately 452 million children  a 5% increase from 2019. Most of them suffer and many die from malnutrition. poor hygiene and insufficient access to healthcare. Most new-born and maternal deaths are due to easily preventable conditions or conditions that could be treated by access to simple and affordable interventions. Crises increase displacement and migration of people. including unaccompanied children. increasing childrens vulnerabilities due to family separation.  labour exploitation and child trafficking.

Due to the ongoing state restructuring process. Swiss support is required for a last phase to ensure the transfer of the institutional and human capacity built-up in trail bridges over the past four decades to the new state and local governments. Walking remains a major mode of travel in Nepal. and trail bridges are still essential for people to access basic public services,Reduced physical accessibility and connectivity for the people living in the remote areas of Nepal has resulted in a high incidence of poverty. which contribute to income disparity and social discrimination with respect to their access to public services. While Nepal till recently made impressive gains in the field of trail bridge building. the re-organisation of the government structures has led to dispersement of the trained human resources.  The newly established local and State governments lack institutional and technical capacities to implement Trail Bridges building programme,the project supports the government of nepal to institutionalize trail bridge building under the new federal structure due to the ongoing state restructuring process swiss support is required for a last phase to ensure the transfer of the institutional and human capacity builtup in trail bridges over the past four decades to the new state and local governments walking remains a major mode of travel in nepal and trail bridges are still essential for people to access basic public services reduced physical accessibility and connectivity for the people living in the remote areas of nepal has resulted in a high incidence of poverty which contribute to income disparity and social discrimination with respect to their access to public services while nepal till recently made impressive gains in the field of trail bridge building the reorganisation of the government structures has led to dispersement of the trained human resources the newly established local and state governments lack institutional and technical capacities to implement trail bridges building programme,More than 4.3 million additional people will benefit from 2400 new trail bridges for safer crossings;About 5.5 million person days (p-days) employment generated with at least 2.7 million p-days targeted to disadvantaged groups and 2 million p-days targeted for women in the construction of trail bridges;Private sector (consultants. non-government organizations. fabricators. contractors);All 753 local governments. 7 State Governments and the Federal Government will benefit from enhanced capacities to implement and enforce the trail bridge strategy in a federal context.,From mid-2009 to mid-2018. an additional 8 million people benefited from 3175 new trail bridges. on average gaining 2.3 hours per person on every 2 way trip they make using a trail bridge. The main reasons for people to cross the bridges were to perform household chores (30%). go to schools (30%). markets (17%). social functions (12%) and access health facilities (10%). Over 1.3 million people cross the bridges daily. Over 7.9 million person days of employment were generated during the construction  (Source: Trail Bridge Strategy Information System 2018).

Thematic priorities are gender equality in fragile contexts and strengthening the economic and political participation of women. The most important measures are a strategic policy dialogue. investment in knowledge management and gender expertise. as well as capacity building and quality assurance for increased impact orientation.  ,Gender inequality remains one of the greatest obstacles to sustainable development. economic growth and poverty reduction. Poverty still has a strong gender dimension. which limits women&#39;s access to resources. work and income.

By supporting platforms dedicated to culture and the arts. the SDC aims to contribute to strengthening the country&#39;s social capital. The CP has three operational components and focuses on the north of the country. with Cabo Delgado as its centre. with a community orientation - an area where the SDC has been a pioneer in the culture for development approach - as well as on the capital region of Maputo and its surroundings. The CP is fully in line with the SDC Mozambique Country Strategy 2017-2020.,The wealth and potential of the cultural sector in Mozambique are remarkable and particularly relevant to development processes. But this wealth and potential is hampered by weak legal. policy and institutional frameworks for arts and culture and a chronic lack of financial resources. Government structures that support the emergence of arts and culture suffer from high centralization and weak skills. This credit proposal is based on the recognition that arts and culture are important for development. as anchored in the SDCs Culture and Development Policy (2016). The underlying assumption is that arts and culture help individuals to broaden their life choices and adapt to change. while promoting economic growth. Engaging in promoting arts and culture to foster development makes particular sense in Mozambique  whether in metropolitan areas where arts institutions and agents can nurture pluralism. humanism and critical thinking or in rural and remote areas where supporting culture is an effective way to reach out and support diverse and often marginalised local communities.,cultural programme cpm this programme builds on the richness and potential of mozambican culture for human development by supporting platforms dedicated to culture and the arts the sdc aims to contribute to strengthening the countrys social capital the cp has three operational components and focuses on the north of the country with cabo delgado as its centre with a community orientation an area where the sdc has been a pioneer in the culture for development approach as well as on the capital region of maputo and its surroundings the cp is fully in line with the sdc mozambique country strategy the wealth and potential of the cultural sector in mozambique are remarkable and particularly relevant to development processes but this wealth and potential is hampered by weak legal policy and institutional frameworks for arts and culture and a chronic lack of financial resources government structures that support the emergence of arts and culture suffer from high centralization and weak skills this credit proposal is based on the recognition that arts and culture are important for development as anchored in the sdcs culture and development policy the underlying assumption is that arts and culture help individuals to broaden their life choices and adapt to change while promoting economic growth engaging in promoting arts and culture to foster development makes particular sense in mozambique whether in metropolitan areas where arts institutions and agents can nurture pluralism humanism and critical thinking or in rural and remote areas where supporting culture is an effective way to reach out and support diverse and often marginalised local communities,Private cultural organisationsYouth. artists. artistic directors/producers participating in activities/courses organised by the above-mentioned persons; artists,The overly ambitious objectives of Phase III. given the difficult context and the level of maturity of potential partners. particularly in the North. were major limitations throughout the phase. The implementation framework was also probably too complex. which had a negative impact on local ownership as well as data collection and monitoring. While Phase III of the Culture Programme was still able to identify structuring initiatives. it was only able to do so thanks to a disproportionate commitment from the Embassy. both in administrative and substantive support and monitoring. At this stage. and in the case of its restructuring. the management of the programme must be streamlined. It will no longer be possible to guarantee that the human resources that had been envisaged for the implementation of Phase III can still be mobilised for Phase IV.,Strengthen institutions and platforms that can serve as a provider of cultural and artistic services to surrounding communities; as providers of knowledge. space and services to cultural agents; and/or as advocates and promoters of Arts and Culture in general.Expected Result: Strengthened capacities and motivation of cultural actors to interact with and provide a meaningful cultural offer to and for the Mozambican population.Promote debates and critical thinking through artistic and cultural activities.Expected Result: More aware. vocal and articulate people.Involve vulnerable people in cultural activities in order to strengthen their self-esteem/confidence. sense of responsibility and initiative.Expected Result: Contribution to the empowerment of local community members.,Platforms for interaction between cultural actors and with the publicCultural platforms. associations and new or strengthened networksCultural actions,To contribute to Mozambique&#39;s rich and diverse cultural scene and enhance the country&#39;s social capital.

Established in 1948. it has distinguished itself in particular as the guardian of the biodiversity of species and. increasingly. of the ecosystems that guarantee the cycle of life on earth. By its composition and status. it enables dialogue between civil society. governments. science and the private sector.,The main goal of IUCN is to contribute to preserving the natural heritage of our planet. both at the level of species and ecosystems. Through its strong orientation in its new 2017-2020 programme towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). IUCN will strive to contribute to solving global problems related. among other things. to the field of adaptation to climate change and disaster risk reduction.,Switzerland&#39;s support in the form of a framework contribution of around CHF 2.2 million per year has enabled IUCN to increase the scope of its projects. develop new monitoring instruments and initiate a profound restructuring of the institution in terms of its operations. In the thematic area. the role of ecosystem services has been addressed and supported at all levels.,This unique phase of a limited duration of one year serves as a transition phase following the decision of the SDC to no longer support IUCN with framework contributions in the future. The financial support should enable IUCN to continue its reform process and to identify new sources of money in order to resolve the structural problem of declining framework contributions. It will also possibly allow the administration of the Swiss Confederation to explore alternatives to the SDC framework funding.,Given the special nature of this last and short phase. the faded effects are relatively modest. They are mainly limited to contributing to finding a sustainable and relevant solution for the future institutional support (i.e. a framework contribution) by the Confederation to the IUCN. This effort will have to be undertaken in close coordination and in agreement with the other involved entities of the federal administration.,Over the past four years. IUCN has continued to build global recognition and reputation as one of the leading international environmental NGOs. earning it a permanent seat at all Rio conventions. Through considerable effort. IUCN has also managed to achieve accredited project implementation status for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF).,IUCN receives many contributions from various sources. Unrestricted contributions to the programme come mainly from the Nordic countries. the Union of Arab Emirates (UAE). and the MAVA Foundation of the Hoffmann La Roche family. Recently. however. several of these donors have suffered financial cuts that have forced them to either reduce (e.g. Finland 50%). interrupt (e.g. UEA) or stop (e.g. Denmark) financial support. Others have problematic prospects. such as the MAVA Foundation. which will be abandoned within a few years.,The SDC is part of the group of principal donors (&#39;framework donors&#39;) who closely monitor the development of the IUCN programme. the implementation methods and the results obtained. Through the participation of the SDC in the annual meeting organised by the IUCN headquarters in Gland. direct contact with other donors can be maintained and nurtured.

GWPs main outcomes in the preceding phase lie in the governance improvements introduced by actors at all levels where GWP is active. GWP has supported over 80 countries in managing their water resources. manifested in about 260 water governance outcomes. These outcomes also brought financial returns: GWP-supported plans. strategies. and initiatives influenced water-related investments of more than 1 billion Euro. These included national water management policies and plans. investment plans. and river basin management strategies. , Effective and inclusive water governance and management systems and investments are developed and implemented in  the following strategic anchor areas:-  Water solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals-  Climate resilience through water-  Transboundary water cooperation,- Key actors within and beyond the water sector are engaged and multi-stakholder platforms are established- Interventions are delivered to foster and demonstrate practice for integrated water resources management- Learning processes. products and platforms are introduced in forms that are easily available. attractive. social and timely,The overall goal is to reach a water-secure world. by advancing governance and management of water resources for sustainable and equitable development. ,The support to GWP integrates well in SDCs initiatives like intergrated monitoring SDG 6 (UN Water) and Transboundary Water Cooperation (River Basin Organisations. IUCN and UNECE). As GWP is a network reaching out to basically all players relevant for water governance. there are many synergies with SDCs other projects and partners.

Through this project. the SDC is helping fruit-growers in the region of Meghri in the south of the country to improve and develop their crops and sell their produce on the market.  ,The area of Meghri is located in the very South of Armenia at the border to Iran. The region belongs to the most vulnerable areas in Armenia due to its extreme remoteness and bad road conditions. Farmers in the villages have limited access to markets and practice mostly subsistence agriculture. For more than 30% of Meghris population. horticulture is the main source of income.

They are mainly organized around families. who provide the workforce (between 3 and 10 workers). mostly women. These family farms. due to their low productivity. do not ensure the country&#39;s food security in a sustainable manner and do not provide sufficient income to rural people. This program aims to modernize these family farms so that they better meet the needs of a population whose growth is 3% per year. [1] The active population of Burkina Faso is estimated at 8 million people. http://www.statistiques-mondiales.com/burkina_faso.htm    ,In Burkina Faso. agricultural production is mainly made up of food crops (sorghum. corn. millet. rice. market gardening. etc.). which occupy approximately 90% of the sown areas. Cotton. the main cash crop. represents only 10% of the areas. As for livestock farming. although practiced extensively in the North and Sahel region of the country. it is essentially traditional and extensive. hence the predominance of transhumance. Agricultural activities are organized around family farms. 50.81% of whose workforce is female. However. these farms have relatively low yields. compared to the increase in the population and are very dependent on rainfall. It is therefore necessary to change agricultural practices as part of a more comprehensive support approach. affecting the entire agri-food system. ,support program for the modernization of family farms pamefa in burkina faso agricultural activities constitute the main source of employment and income for of the active population they are mainly organized around families who provide the workforce between and workers mostly women these family farms due to their low productivity do not ensure the countrys food security in a sustainable manner and do not provide sufficient income to rural people this program aims to modernize these family farms so that they better meet the needs of a population whose growth is per year the active population of burkina faso is estimated at million people httpwwwstatistiquesmondialescomburkina_fasohtm in burkina faso agricultural production is mainly made up of food crops sorghum corn millet rice market gardening etc which occupy approximately of the sown areas cotton the main cash crop represents only of the areas as for livestock farming although practiced extensively in the north and sahel region of the country it is essentially traditional and extensive hence the predominance of transhumance agricultural activities are organized around family farms of whose workforce is female however these farms have relatively low yields compared to the increase in the population and are very dependent on rainfall it is therefore necessary to change agricultural practices as part of a more comprehensive support approach affecting the entire agrifood system,12.500 market gardeners (40% women) in the North and Central West regions. 950 rice producers (30% women producers) and 3 unions of rice parboilers (processors) from 3 rice plains. 20.000 pastoralists in the Sahel region around a better use of the Christine drilling area. More than 900 input distributors organized within cooperatives and associations (COCIMA and AGRODIA) Umbrella organizations of producers. in particular the Confédération Paysanne du Faso (CPF) which brings together around 750.000 producers. ,The two phases of the program allowed the introduction of new production techniques to improve water management. New training approaches are being developed within farmers&#39; organizations. enabling more than 2.000 producers (including 670 women producers) to engage in economic management of the farm and control of costs and the market. In the rice sector. more than 200 ha have been rehabilitated and 600 producers. including 177 women. have increased their yields by 57% (from 3.34 tonnes/ha to 5.27 tonnes/ha). In the market gardening sector. the establishment of a price information system has increased the producer purchase price by 37.5%. for 6.300 producers. Increasing productivity through innovative agricultural techniques as well as economic development and diversification activities is proving relevant for rural people.,Rice. market gardening and livestock production have increased thanks to an evolution of production techniques and tools within family farms and equitable access between men and women to quality agricultural inputs and equipment. The income of farmers and livestock breeders has increased by facilitating the processing. conservation. marketing of agro-pastoral products and access to suitable credits.

In the financial year 2013. grants provided by GFDRR have proven critical for leveraging more than USD 3.8 billion in investments by the WB.Besides financing. GFDRR provides on-the-ground technical assistance and capacity building activities. It supports national and local efforts of high-risk. low-income countries for mainstreaming disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) into country-level strategies and policies. thereby reducing human and economic impacts of disasters.,Switzerland defines DRR as a strategic priority in international development cooperation. which is prominently reflected in the 1976 Federal Law on International Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid. Moreover. the 20132016 Swiss Bill on International Cooperation marks the prevention and overcoming of crises. conflicts and natural catastrophes as number one of five strategic commitments.SDC recognizes disaster risk as a threat to poverty reduction and consequently for sustainable development. GFDRRs mandate to mainstream DRR and CCA into development strategies is fully in line with SDCs integrated approach to DRR. Together with the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) and UN Development Programme (UNDP). GFDRR forms part of SDCs multilateral strategic partnership for DRR.,Risk identification: 59 single-country. 17 multi-country and 2 global grants helped over 55 countries improve their ability to identify and understand disaster risks.Risk reduction: 90 grants in over 60 countries supported governments to make reducing risk a key component of their national development strategies.Preparedness: 66 grants enabled over 50 countries to better design and implement forecasting and early warning systems. emergency response plans. emergency training and simulation exercises.Financial protection: 33 grants in 29 countries helped strengthening the financial resilience of governments. the private sector. households and low-income populations.Resilient recovery: GFDRR-supported post-disaster assessments are estimated to have helped guiding USD 3.36 billion in recovery and reconstruction to build 1.7 million homes. 3.600 km of roads. 2.300 schools. 1.400 wells. 685 safe shelters. as well as 600 health facilities.,In its capacity as a member of the Consultative Group (CG).

SDC has worked to strengthen Lao agriculture and forestry colleges since 2009. in response to a growing need for highly skilled professionals. who can help farmers in improving their practices and escape poverty.  ,Agriculture is a central component in the Lao economy. The agriculture sector still generates almost 30 percent of the GDP and employs more than two thirds of the workforce. Particularly poor. ethnic communities in the Northern Uplands depend on agriculture for their food and income.An ongoing shift from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture is demanding farmers to acquire new skills. A successful transition will require many qualified agriculture professionals. who can bring farmers new knowledge about farming practices. input provision. product processing. and marketing. SDC seeks to facilitate this shift through a variety of projects that aim to strengthen the agriculture sector.Lack of skilled human resources in the agriculture sector hampers successful implementation of new farming practices. Agricultural education in Lao PDR often still is of low standard and generally characterized by poor teaching practices. limited linkage between training and practical skills. poor infrastructure. and little to no correlation with the demands of the labor market.Therefore. it is a top priority for the Government of Lao PDR to improve the human resources available in the agriculture sector. The government is committed to answering the need for highly educated and skilled agricultural technicians. who are capable of modernizing the sector.SDC has assisted the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) to formulate a 12-year (2008- 2020) strategy to reform Lao PDRs five agriculture colleges. Since 2009. SDC has specifically supported the reform of the Northern Agriculture and Forestry College (NAFC) in Luang Prabang. through the Support to the Reform of the Northern Agriculture and Forestry College in Laos (SURAFCO) project.

The curriculum for diploma degrees in agronomy. livestock production. agro-business. and forestry have been upgraded. with emphasis on practical experience relevant to the market and upland farming systems.The SURAFCO project has funded major improvements to the colleges infrastructure. including the construction of classrooms for 280 students. a laboratory. two dormitories. twenty livestock and agricultural farm units  for practical training. as well as telephone and internet connections.Lastly. the project has supported the NAFC to develop more transparent management practices. for example by creating job descriptions and job performance indicators.,,SDC will support the NAFC to implement reforms and achieve full sustainability until 2020. During the current second project phase. the project will share new teaching and management practices from the NAFC with the other four agriculture colleges in Lao PDR and it will also focus on evaluating agriculture college graduates skills and ability to enter the labor market.,The projects overall development goal is to establish the NAFC as a broadly recognized centre of excellence for sustainable upland farming systems.

7F06300,2,0,,Effective Grain Storage II,Effective Grain Storage for Better Livelihoods of African Farmers,Post harvest losses are being recognised by all major stakeholders such as Southern African Development Community (SADC). the African Development Bank and FAO as a major problem. Postharvest losses have repercussions on hunger. poverty alleviation. income generation and economic growth. On the other hand besides quantitative losses. qualitative losses imply that the full nutritional value is not delivered. This is particularly important for HIV/AIDS affected population. SDC has a vast experience with metal silo technology in POSTCOSECHA programme in South America and can contribute in the region to the policy dialogue and share experiences with SADC. African Development Bank and FAO including SDC national offices in Zimbabwe and Tanzania.  ,To cope with increasing food demand. governments have traditionally emphasized increasing food production; however. reducing food losses along the food value chain has not been adequately addressed. Yet significant proportions of food produced are lost to spoilage and insect infestation during and after harvest. Postharvest losses in most of sub-Saharan Africa can reach up to 25% of harvested grains. with a value estimated at over US$ 2 billion annually. Investing in reducing post-harvest losses has the potential to save household food reserves that would otherwise be lost. Besides. qualitative losses also occur and imply that the full nutritional value is not delivered. This is particularly important for the HIV/AIDS affected population. Lack of adequate awareness and access to appropriate storage technologies also make farmers sell their maize soon after the harvest. only to buy maize back at a higher price later in the season. resulting in a continual poverty trap.

SADC and national agriculture policymakers for enhancing postharvest policies.,Phase 1 showed that the metal silo technology is effective in combating grain losses at the storage stage but remains quite expensive for poor farmers. Policy changes and incentives are required to provide an enabling environment for increased adoption rates of this technology. In addition. cheaper technologies should be made available to poorer farmers. women in particular. so that they too can extend the storage period of their harvest by a few months. Sharing experiences at the regional level. with the view to having an harmonised system for all SADC countries. could enhance national dialogues with all the respective stakeholders and enable the required policy changes., Targeted farmers increase their uptake of the  metal silo technology for grain storage. building on the lessons learnt in Phase 1;Post-harvest policies in Southern Africa are conducive and harmonised in the long term;Poor farmers. esp. women. use alternative improved storage technologies to store grain crops., Resource-poor farmers are less poor and more food-secure through  effective grain storage policies and technologies in Southern Africa.,Post-harvest grain losses are reduced. and the food security and incomes of targeted farmers households are improved in Malawi.

7F06552,2,0,,PROCEDURE Promotion of Microinsurance,Rural microinsurance,Micro insurance is recognised as a useful tool for poverty reduction. However. costs for developing micro insurance products are too high for the private sector to assume them alone. SDC will share this risk with the PROFIN Foundation . who will validate the technical. legal and financial feasibility of commercialising agricultural micro insurances in Bolivia. With two pilots. this initiative will reach more than 1000 vulnerable men and women. who do not have access to adequate risk-management tools.,About 80% of the population in Bolivia is exposed to climate risks. many of which could be effectively mitigated by insurance. However. in spite of a market potential of several million USD per year (prime volume). the insurance sector is rather small. and micro insurance to cover agricultural production practically inexistent (supply side). For this reason. many potential clients are unaware of the protection effect of micro insurance. which makes consumers education necessary as well (demand side).

Concerning the latter. 5000 people will also have access to it. The potential indirect target group is of around 250000 small agricultural producers.,Micro: The PROFIN Foundation and its partners have undertaken research and development of agricultural microinsurance products in 3 departments and 21 municipalities. providing more than 1000 smallholders (of which 12% women) with insurance coverage. Two private sector companies collaborated. and one is already planning to independently sell the product in another department from next year. Meso: Coordination with the municipality of Uriondo and departemental governments. to develop microinsurance against hail. The involvement from the Federation of Producers in the Departmentof Tarija was also insured. Macro: PROFIN has assisted the Government in the elaboration of law 144. that prescibes the creation of agricultural insurance. based on the evidence generated by SDC funded pilot projects.,The main outcome aimed at is to generate evidence that will lead to the creation of a micro insurance market for the agricultural sector in Bolivia. At programme level outcomes are: Direct beneficiaries:Demand side: More than 1000 poor men and women are covered by micro insurance in the pilots and have received financial education;Supply side: the actors of the Bolivian micro insurance sector (insurance companies. re-insurance companies. public sector. professional associations. etc.) improve their capacities and are organised. allowing better cooperation and regulation;Demand side: At least 5000 potential clients receive financial education on insuranceIndirect beneficiaries: Crowding-in of insurance companies (supply) into the market multiplies the number of direct beneficiaries (demand).,The Project divides its impact into three components. to which are added the actions to combat the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. managing to secure the lives of more than 45 thousand people with limited income. belonging to groups of honey. chocolate. cocoa producers. artisans. domestic workers and union members. among others. With these inclusive products. the vulnerability of men (42%) and women (58%) was reduced. who can count on a protection tool valid for one year.,Contribute to poverty reduction and food security. by fostering an increasing and more stable rural production. and insuring a better income thanks to functioning microinsurance markets.,Pension and Insurance Supervision and Control Authority (APS).Bolivian Association of Insurers (ABA)Solidar Switzerland,,,,2012,31.10.2020 00:00,3070000,3117599.02,,,,[agency:sdc],[aidtype:mandatewithfiduciaryfunds],[partnercontract:non-profitorgofsoutheast],PROFIN Foundation,[partnercontracttype:ngo-international-foreign],,[],SCO La Paz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Activate,08.10.2019 10:46,reference-adjustment-service,Activate,08.10.2019 10:46,reference-adjustment-service,,Bolivia,500,,7F-06552,7F-06552.02,3.609736,0.0,27.0,Bolivia

Reforms have been initiated by the government to promote the agricultural and livestock sectors. Building on the achievements of previous phases. the SDC aims to scale up the program by expanding the geographical area of intervention throughout the North and increasing the number of target sectors. while adopting a more economical approach that creates jobs for young people and women.,The sector employs approximately 70% of the working population. mainly living in rural areas. contributes nearly 33% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). provides approximately 75% of export revenues and 15% of state revenues [1]. It is characterized by stable growth. with a strong underexploited potential. It is dominated by small family farms. by low diversification. by subsistence farming. by significant soil degradation and by its vulnerability to climate variability. Women and young people are more affected by limited access to production factors. The institutional reforms undertaken aim. among other things. at diversifying agricultural sectors capable of contributing to GDP and structured according to geographical poles. However. the new institutions set up to promote the sectors are not very functional and their skills remain weak. A transfer of skills to the new structures is therefore necessary as well as support for the role of socio-professional organizations (OSP) in the new system. More recently - also in connection with the closure of the border between Nigeria and Benin - a structural transformation of the Beninese economy is envisaged and opens the opportunity to develop an agricultural sector more oriented towards the marketing of its reinforced production.

Bridging Credit,Sustainable Land Management Project (SLMP),The rural population in Afghanistan suffers from overexploited and rapidly deteriorating land and water resources. Policies for sustainable land management are only slowly emerging. There is an urgent and sustained need for professional and institutional capacity for sustainable land management to prevent further degradation. improve production and reduce disaster risks. This reduces vulnerability and contributes to improved food security and better livelihoods for poor rural families.,Over one third of the Afghan population lives below the national poverty line and 30% are food insecure.  Poverty rates are higher in rural areas. where they reach 50%. With an estimated three quarters of the population living in rural areas. agriculture is of crucial importance for Afghanistans socioeconomic development and the livelihoods of the people.The countrys population growth rate is very high. Combined with the prevailing inheritance system. the landholding per household is decreasing. This limits the agricultural production per household and results in persistent food insecurity of many rural families. In addition. water shortages. deforestation and overgrazing impact negatively on agricultural production. as do recurrent droughts and natural disasters including floods and landslides. The main focus of agricultural development policies is on irrigation and cash crops produced by medium to big farms. Sustainable small-scale farming in rain-fed areas has so far received little attention.,sustainable land management project slmp the rural population in afghanistan suffers from overexploited and rapidly deteriorating land and water resources policies for sustainable land management are only slowly emerging there is an urgent and sustained need for professional and institutional capacity for sustainable land management to prevent further degradation improve production and reduce disaster risks this reduces vulnerability and contributes to improved food security and better livelihoods for poor rural families over one third of the afghan population lives below the national poverty line and are food insecure poverty rates are higher in rural areas where they reach with an estimated three quarters of the population living in rural areas agriculture is of crucial importance for afghanistans socioeconomic development and the livelihoods of the peoplethe countrys population growth rate is very high combined with the prevailing inheritance system the landholding per household is decreasing this limits the agricultural production per household and results in persistent food insecurity of many rural families in addition water shortages deforestation and overgrazing impact negatively on agricultural production as do recurrent droughts and natural disasters including floods and landslides the main focus of agricultural development policies is on irrigation and cash crops produced by medium to big farms sustainable smallscale farming in rainfed areas has so far received little attention,Field practitioners (e.g. government and private extensionists.

Moreover. SLMP contributed to knowledge management through the documentation of case examples and disseminated information on sustainable land management options through local radio.In this phase. a stronger focus on government staff and women is required and will be helped by increasingly conducting trainings and providing materials in local languages. The localised approach used so far has its limits. SLMP will therefore diversify locally and link its experience and results to national actors.,Outcome 1: Natural resource management professionals and university students have enhanced knowledge and skills in sustainable land and water management.Outcome 2: Sustainable and locally relevant land and water management techniques and tools relevant for Afghanistan are documented and shared.,Output 1.1: Practical short-term training packages on sustainable land and water management are adapted or developed.Output 1.2: Resource persons. field professionals. university students trained and made aware on sustainable land and water management concepts. tools. methods and options.Output 1.3: Resource Persons provide a systematic coaching of Field Practitioners in order to improve curricula and enhance application.Output 2.1: Practitioners are trained on WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies) methodology and tools.Output 2.2: Case examples on sustainable land and water management are documented and disseminated.,Afghan professional capacities to undertake sustainable and more effective management of land and water resources are enhanced.,SDC projects: Improving Livelihoods for Rural Communities (ILRC.

7F07219,3,0,,AFR55. EcoWap. Phase 3,Support for the implementation of the West African agricultural policy (ECOWAP),In West Africa. more than 64% of the population is under 24 years old. The weakness of agricultural value chains does not allow these young people to access decent jobs. Switzerland supports the creation of remunerative jobs in the local milk sector for young people. It is counting on the leverage effect of its action to help reduce rural exodus and uncontrolled emigration and offer young people alternatives to joining violent groups.,A large majority of young people in West Africa do not have access to sufficiently remunerative employment in the rural economy due to the weak structuring of agricultural value chains and family farms that are not very profitable and highly dependent on climatic hazards. This carries the risk of seeing young people give in to uncontrolled emigration and violent extremist groups. Some sectors such as local milk offer strong opportunities to reverse this trend. It is estimated that only 3% of the 5 billion liters of fresh milk produced per year is collected. processed and marketed. while milk imports are estimated at CHF 1 billion per year. In this context. the challenges to be met are: (i) Increasing livestock productivity; (ii) Increasing the volumes of milk collected; (iii) Strengthening the local milk processing network. Through the previous phases of the programme. the SDC has mainly supported the processes of developing regional agricultural policy as well as regional strategies (youth employment and promotion of local milk). This phase is the last of the ECOWAS agricultural policy support programme and aims to contribute to the implementation of concrete actions for youth employment in the local milk sector.,support for the implementation of the west african agricultural policy ecowap in west africa more than of the population is under years old the weakness of agricultural value chains does not allow these young people to access decent jobs switzerland supports the creation of remunerative jobs in the local milk sector for young people it is counting on the leverage effect of its action to help reduce rural exodus and uncontrolled emigration and offer young people alternatives to joining violent groups a large majority of young people in west africa do not have access to sufficiently remunerative employment in the rural economy due to the weak structuring of agricultural value chains and family farms that are not very profitable and highly dependent on climatic hazards this carries the risk of seeing young people give in to uncontrolled emigration and violent extremist groups some sectors such as local milk offer strong opportunities to reverse this trend it is estimated that only of the billion liters of fresh milk produced per year is collected processed and marketed while milk imports are estimated at chf billion per year in this context the challenges to be met are i increasing livestock productivity ii increasing the volumes of milk collected iii strengthening the local milk processing network through the previous phases of the programme the sdc has mainly supported the processes of developing regional agricultural policy as well as regional strategies youth employment and promotion of local milk this phase is the last of the ecowas agricultural policy support programme and aims to contribute to the implementation of concrete actions for youth employment in the local milk sector,Young men and women aged 18 to 35 from the ECOWAS region and Chad. Indirect beneficiaries are: consumers. States. input distributors. service providers. etc. The ECOWAS Commission and more specifically the Directorate of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development (DADR) and its implementing agency. the Regional Agency for Agriculture and Food ARAA. ,During the previous phases. Swiss support focused on the development of agricultural policies at the regional and country levels. Regional farmers&#39; organizations were supported for active participation in the formulation of these policies. based on experiences capitalized on the ground. Examples of results obtained by these organizations were: (i) reducing conflicts and developing regional trade by boosting regional multi-stakeholder consultations and cross-border committees; (ii) structuring sectors. particularly milk. rice. and fish farming. by facilitating national and regional platforms. It is on this basis that ECOWAS adopted the rice offensive and the milk offensive; (iii) improving the marketing of agricultural products by capitalizing on successful experiences in the region. These achievements have enabled farmers&#39; organizations to contribute effectively to the formulation of the ECOWAS regional agricultural policy (ECOWAP2025) as well as national rural sector programs in the countries. The region thus has a more inclusive agricultural policy because it takes better account of the interests of family farms. pastoralists. women. young people. etc. The Swiss contribution also enabled ECOWAS and its partners to develop two regional strategies for youth employment in agriculture and for the promotion of local milk. as well as their priority investment programs. This phase constitutes the last phase of the program and aims to consolidate the achievements in terms of collaboration between regional actors (public. farmers&#39; organizations. research institutes. etc.) around the challenges of the rural sector in the region. with a focus on the milk sector.  ,     Decent employment opportunities for young people (men and women) in the local milk sector are increased. thanks to pilot projects resulting from calls for proposals; The technical and economic performance of local milk value chains is improved. through increased productivity and milk production. increased volumes of milk collected and processed and better access to the local dairy market; The conditions for the emergence of efficient local milk value chains that provide jobs for young people are improved; ECOWAS/DADR carries out effective strategic management. mobilizes additional resources. and implements projects effectively and efficiently.,     Techno-economic models for strengthening the employability of young people in the local milk value chain are developed and promoted Young people are trained on the use of proven techno-economic models for the supply of inputs. service delivery. production. collection. processing and distribution of local dairy products The organizational capacities of ECOWAS/DADR are strengthened: strategic management. resource mobilization. project implementation ,Facilitate the maintenance and socio-professional integration of young people (men and women) in agricultural and agri-food value chains in the local milk sector - to: (i) reduce underemployment and unemployment of workers. and (ii) minimize rural exodus and uncontrolled migration.,The ECOWAS Commission and more specifically the Directorate of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development (DADR) and its implementing agency. the Regional Agency for Agriculture and Food ARAA.,,,,2022,31.12.2026 00:00,9850000,3218353.55,,,,[agency:sdc],[aidtype:mandatewithoutfiduciaryfund. aidtype:projectprogrammecontribution],[partnercontract:otheroi. partnercontract:privatesectorofsoutheast],,[partnercontracttype:otherinternationalorganizations. partnercontracttype:privatesector],,[],SCO Ouagadougou.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Activate,30.05.2022 16:03,patricia.godel@eda.admin.ch,Activate,08.10.2019 10:46,reference-adjustment-service,,West Africa,500,,7F-07219,7F-07219.03,1.494634,0.0,9.0,"Western Africa, regional"

UNISDR is mandated to oversee the implementation of the SFDRR. undertake efforts to ensure that the UN Plan of Action on DRR for Resilience translates into effective support to countries and communities. and to bring disaster risk management and disaster resilience to new levels of international engagement. commitment and action.UNISDR regularly organizes the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction. which is recognized by the UN General Assembly. It is the main forum at the global level for strategic advice. coordination. partnership development and the review of progress in the implementation of the SFDRR. The 2017 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction will be held in Cancun. Mexico from 22-26 May.,DRR is a strategic priority of the Swiss Government and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Switzerlands political commitment in this particular field is reflected in the Federal Law of 1976 on International Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid. DRR also features prominently in the 2017-2020 Dispatch on International Cooperation and is one of four core themes of SDCs Humnaitarian Aid Department.At DRR policy level. Switzerland supported the 1994 Yokohama Strategy and Plan of Action for a Safer World. became a driving force behind the 2005 Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA). and contributed significantly with expertise and funding to the successful establishment of the SFDRR in March 2015. Switzerland will be hosting the 2019 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in Geneva.Switzerland considers UNISDR a key partner to bring the international DRR agenda forward.,Persistent lobbying and campaigning by UNISDR has been instrumental for achieving an unprecedented level of momentum for a now truly global risk management agenda.3557 cities  from small towns to major world capitals  have joined the Making Cities Resilient Campaign initiated by UNISDR and signed up to commit to  Ten Essentials of urban disaster resilience.UNISDR successfully coordinated and supervised the Global Assessment Report (GAR). a biennial assessment of DRR and a comprehensive review and analysis of the natural hazards that affect humanity.Over the past two years (2015-2016). UNISDR has put major focus on inter-governmental consultations for effective implementation of the SFDRR adopted in March 2015.In February 2017. the UN General Assembly endorsed the Sendai/DRR monitoring indicators developed by an Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group (OIEWG). The prosess was successfully coordinated by UNISDR.Together with Mexico as host. and in consultation with SFDRR member states. UNISDR has organized the 5th Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction to take place in Cancún from 22-26 May 2017.,In mid-2016. the new DRR Special Representative to the Secretary-General. Robert Glasser. launched within UNISDR an urgently needed change process. Key drivers influencing the new organizational structure are increased clarity on accountabilities. the drive to strengthen the human resource capacity of the UNISDR regional offices. consolidation of small sub-regional offices into the regional offices. and the shift in the organizational culture to fully embrace UNISDRs convening and catalytic role in bringing together member states and partners within and outside the UN system for disaster risk reduction.The key elements of the change process are to be concluded by the end of 2017. including the roll out of the new organizational structure.The UNISDR change process is composed of the following eight elements:Organizational set up and structure.Financing. including both increased cost efficiency and savings as well as a renewed resource mobilization strategy. which focusses on predictable multi-year unearmarked funding and broadening of the donor base to enable UNISDR to focus on its core role and to reduce reliance on project funding.Review and optimization of business processes.Internal communication.Management culture. including enhanced performance management.Staff development.External communication.Partnership strategy.,A strong UNISDR with a clear-cut mandate. profile and strategic focus.UNISDR should serve as the UN DRR centre of excellence:offering norms. standards and guidance to the UN system and beyond and.providing evidence-based and robust reporting and review on the progress of the Sendai Framework.being a key driver for the establishment and and subsequent implementation (by UN agencies) of the UN Action Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience.While main focus is on the implementation of the Sendai Framework. Switzerland will provide support to UNISDR for reviewing and further improving its governance structure (as part of the ongoing change process) and to enhance cooperation between UNISDR and its various partners in the UN system and the Development Banks.UNISDR may benefit in the future from a revised governance structure including a consultative group with decision-making authority. in addition to broader existing fora such as the ISDR support group and the various advisory groups.Coherence and effective DRR governance across the UN system is key: UNISDRs positioning and connectedness within the UN system. not least vis-a-vis UNOCHA and UNDP. requires improvement. Switzerland is suppportive of measures that lead to stronger coordination. collective responsibility for implementing Sendai and increased mainstreaming of DRR in UN programmes and  projects at all levels.To avoid duplications and foster a more cohesive approach among UN agencies. Switzerland seeks greater clarity regarding UNISDRs membership and role in inter-agency groupings such as the Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative (CADRI).,Active support for UNISDR in fulfilling its coordination role in the post-Sendai era and help promoting political leadership in terms of commitment to the newly adopted Sendai Framework.Strategic commitment to ensure inter-connected­ness and coherence of the Sendai Framework with other post-2015 policy processes with a particular view on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Climate Change Agenda (UNFCCC / Paris Declaration).Financial and technical support (two Swiss experts) for the work of the OIEWG and the successful establishment of a set of feasible  SFDRR monitoring indicators.Effective Swiss lobbying for an integrated approach of DRR supporting linkages between humanitarian response. sustainable development. environment and climate change. not least in its role as Co-Chair of the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). of which UNISDR is a member.Support to UNISDR for establishing a more efficient and effective Secretariat in Geneva and Field Offices.,In 2016. UNISDR received earmarked and unearmarked contributions from 18 governments. 3 institutions (incl. European Commission.

The beneficiaries of the project are around 6500 subsistence and semi-subsistence livestock producing households. totalling approx. 20000 people in the three target districts.,During the planning phase several in-depth analyses of the livestock market system. of the beneficiaries and their environment. and of relevant market players and other stakeholders were conducted. These assessments revealed that livestock farming in the Kakheti region is a promising because of its potential for growth. among others owing to the low cost of key inputs. good pastures and adequate land for fodder production. as well as favorable marketing opportunities due to the vicinity to the capital Tbilisi. However. it was also found out that the livestock sector faces a number of constraints which significantly limit inclusive and sustainable sector growth. The Project intends to address some of those key constraints. e.g. the inadequate supply of veterinary services and information on seed. feed and fertilizers.,The following three outcomes shall be achieved during the present project phase :Subsistence and semi-subsistence livestock farmers have increased production due to improved access to services. inputs and information on animal health. breeding and nutritionSubsistence and semi-subsistence livestock farmers have increased their income due to a more favourable market access and terms of trade for dairy and meat productsLocal and regional governments have enhanced capacities to support the inclusive and coherent growth of the agricultural sector which is more resilient to livelihood related disaster risksAs a result of more efficient production and better sales opportunities. it is expected that farmers will be able to increase their income by 10 to 20% during the phase,,The income of farmers in Southern Georgia shall be increased by contributing to the transition towards a sustainable market economy in the livestock sector. The purpose of the project is to enable the livestock market system to function more inclusively for subsistence and semi-subsistence livestock farmers in Kakheti. resulting in improved incomes. well-being and resilience to livelihood related disaster risks.

A new national training program in chained masonry based on the content of the CCR is currently being validated by the National Institute for Vocational Training (December 2015). The certification by the State of 600 masons from the informal sector (including 6 women) has made it possible to propose a pilot for the validation of acquired experience. Lessons learned: The most important lesson from the CCR experience is that the focus on &quot;supply&quot; (e.g. training) must. from the outset. find its counterpart in &quot;demand&quot; (willingness to use the tools and training provided).,The chained masonry training offer is perpetuated through vocational training centers (formal/informal) and certain universities. Schools rebuilt by the School Infrastructure Reconstruction Support Program (PARIS) meet seismic/cyclonic resistance standards and school construction stakeholders have tools that facilitate the implementation of standard plans. Vocational training stakeholders take ownership of the key initiatives launched by the CCR and reinforced by the new Regional Cooperation program.,The national initial masonry training program is adapted to integrate MC concepts from the advanced training program validated in the previous phase. The vocational training centers located in the 4 most at-risk areas of the country have received support to integrate the new chained masonry programs. At least 2 new universities have received support to integrate the practical training modules in chained masonry developed by the CCR. More than 50 masons have received training certified by the INFP through a civil society training center (ATECO). On-site training modules to improve the quality of implementation of the SDC&#39;s standard school plans are made available to stakeholders.

SAMP1 managed to mobilize close to 4.500 small-scale farmers and support them in becoming seed producers. SAMP1 had managed to increase the number of agro-dealers (ZW) from 1 in 2010. to 27 in 2013. and that this had led to an increase in the sale of seed from 50 tons (Seed Co. maize) to 86.5 tons over the same period.

Switzerland supports small-scale irrigation (a priority area for the Nigerien government) to offer women and young people opportunities for employment and agricultural income. but also to modernize EFs and contribute to the country&#39;s food security. This will also contribute to peace and stability in Niger.          ,Niger has an irrigable potential of 270.000 ha. of which 107.000 ha are developed. The development of large-scale irrigated schemes has proven to be inefficient in exploiting this potential (costly investments. few irrigators have benefited from them). Due to the significant drop in investment costs. small-scale irrigation appears to be a promising alternative for family farms (FF). particularly for young people and women. Recent studies by the University of Lausanne &amp; the National Network of Chambers of Agriculture have shown that small-scale family irrigation increases income. food security and reduces migration within FF. ,papi smallscale irrigation support program in niger food security depends on the performance of family farms that are no longer able to provide their own food switzerland supports smallscale irrigation a priority area for the nigerien government to offer women and young people opportunities for employment and agricultural income but also to modernize efs and contribute to the countrys food security this will also contribute to peace and stability in niger niger has an irrigable potential of ha of which ha are developed the development of largescale irrigated schemes has proven to be inefficient in exploiting this potential costly investments few irrigators have benefited from them due to the significant drop in investment costs smallscale irrigation appears to be a promising alternative for family farms ff particularly for young people and women recent studies by the university of lausanne amp the national network of chambers of agriculture have shown that smallscale family irrigation increases income food security and reduces migration within ff, Family farms. young people and women irrigators in the Dosso and Maradi regions; Farmers&#39; organizations; Micro. small and medium-sized enterprises in the small-scale irrigation sector; Regional Chambers of Agriculture (CRA) and the National Network of Chambers of Agriculture (RECA). ,The main results and lessons of phase 1: Switzerland played a leading role in defining a financing and agricultural advisory policy at the national level; Management advice helped increase productivity (76%) and crop yields (over 50% overall); More than 400 family farms run by women benefited from financing from financial institutions; The supply of bank credit was lacking and requires exploring other alternatives (microfinance institutions); Digital applications had a multiplier effect on producers&#39; access to innovations. financial services and the market.  , Family farms increase their production and income from small-scale irrigation; Vulnerable groups (youth and women) have secure access to small-scale irrigation; Framework conditions enable the development of small-scale family irrigation. more specifically for young people and women., Around 6.000 EFs benefit from advice (production techniques. water management. crop protection. marketing of produce. etc.) and at least 2.500 benefit from financing; Around 2.500 women and young people with skills in small-scale irrigation have improved their income; At least 90% of the infrastructure built is efficient with satisfactory business models and management methods; The State&#39;s capacities are strengthened in terms of resource mobilization and coordination of interventions in the small-scale irrigation sector; Economical technologies are introduced into the small-scale irrigation sector (digital services. renewable energies).,Contribute to the food security of family farms in the Maradi and Dosso regions through the development of small-scale irrigation., DDC Niger: PAOP (farmers&#39; organizations); PROMEL (CdV/M4P); PASEFA (land) PACT (decentralization).

7F07801,2,0,,Chad-Knowledge/water resource management,Water Resources Mapping ,A large part of Chadian territory suffers from a chronic water shortage. while the country has significant groundwater and surface resources. This situation is due to a lack of knowledge of resources and the absence of a water policy in Chad. In this context. the SDC wants to support the improvement of knowledge on water resources and strengthen the capacities of key actors to establish active. sustainable and sovereign management of water resources in Chad.,Better knowledge of water resources has a definite impact in many areas: agriculture. livestock. health. etc. Aware of this state of affairs. of the challenges and issues related to access to and management of water resources. Chad adopted a Water Code in 1999 and a policy document entitled the Water and Sanitation Master Plan (SDEA) in 2003. However. the Ministry of Livestock and Hydraulics (MEH) lacks the means and competent resources to implement the adopted policy. which nevertheless represents a vital issue for the development of the country. Various donors such as the French Development Agency (AFD). the European Union (EU) and UNICEF are involved in the sector; the latter generally focus their actions in the area of village hydraulics (WASH. well construction. drilling). The coherence of these initiatives is a priority issue for the effectiveness of the actions carried out. This function falls to the Chadian State. but the latter. due to the weakness of its institutional capacities. is not able to fully assume its sovereign role. Phase 2 of the ResEau project continues the work of production and mapping of knowledge initiated in phase 1. while placing particular emphasis on the institutional strengthening of the MEH. in particular by the development of national capacities at the central and regional levels. The efforts made should lead to an active resource management policy and a minimal organization of the water sector. allowing for a coordinated and effective use of the resources available.,water resources mapping a large part of chadian territory suffers from a chronic water shortage while the country has significant groundwater and surface resources this situation is due to a lack of knowledge of resources and the absence of a water policy in chad in this context the sdc wants to support the improvement of knowledge on water resources and strengthen the capacities of key actors to establish active sustainable and sovereign management of water resources in chad better knowledge of water resources has a definite impact in many areas agriculture livestock health etc aware of this state of affairs of the challenges and issues related to access to and management of water resources chad adopted a water code in and a policy document entitled the water and sanitation master plan sdea in however the ministry of livestock and hydraulics meh lacks the means and competent resources to implement the adopted policy which nevertheless represents a vital issue for the development of the country various donors such as the french development agency afd the european union eu and unicef are involved in the sector the latter generally focus their actions in the area of village hydraulics wash well construction drilling the coherence of these initiatives is a priority issue for the effectiveness of the actions carried out this function falls to the chadian state but the latter due to the weakness of its institutional capacities is not able to fully assume its sovereign role phase of the reseau project continues the work of production and mapping of knowledge initiated in phase while placing particular emphasis on the institutional strengthening of the meh in particular by the development of national capacities at the central and regional levels the efforts made should lead to an active resource management policy and a minimal organization of the water sector allowing for a coordinated and effective use of the resources available,Ministry of Livestock and Hydraulics (MEH)Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS)Water stakeholders in Chad (drilling companies.

Thanks to improved access to agricultural inputs and services. access to output markets and financial services. they will generate an additional income of CHF 14.5 million to be invested into the diversification of their farm business and basic needs.,Approximately 2.5 million people live in the chars of Northern Bangladesh spread across 1.200 villages under 10 districts. Their main livelihood choices are subsistence farming and seasonal daily wage labor in mainland areas of the country. Char dwellers migrate several times within their lifetime due to the chars vulnerability to flooding and river erosion. which often cause char inhabitants to lose their assets like livestock. homestead and farming lands. The situation is further aggravated due to the geographic isolation of the chars. which results in poor access to markets and services. leading to fewer economic activities and lower productivity. The higher costs of product and service delivery. non-existent market infrastructure. limited information and understanding of market actors and investors about the economic potential in chars as well as high risks make chars unattractive for private investment and difficult for public service delivery. As a result. people living on chars are not only poor but lead an extremely vulnerable life with limited livelihood choices. While the health impact of the covid-19 pandemic is still limited due to the geographic isolation. the economic repercussions are starting to be felt as migrant workers from the chars lose their incomes and supply chains for fresh produce to the cities have been interrupted.M4C has benefited from the expertise and networks gained by SDC and Swisscontact over the years. Thanks to its geographic orientation and focus on the most poverty-prone. isolated areas. it has done a tremendous job at targeting the extreme poor. with over a third of total phase 2 beneficiaries living on less than 1.25 USD a day. Unlike most agricultural market development projects in the country. it has gained wide recognition and appraisal from the Government of Bangladesh. who has experienced firsthand the effectiveness of the approaches deployed by the project.

7F08123,1,0,,MRC. Phase 1,Integrated Water Management of the Lower Mekong Basin, The Mekong River holds immense economic. social. ecological. and cultural importance. An estimated forty million people. living in Cambodia. Lao PDR. Thailand. and Vietnam. rely on the river to support their agriculture and fisheries. In 2011. SDC reinstated its support to the Mekong River Commission (MRC). an inter-governmental institution. to contribute to equitable development and environmental protection in the Lower Mekong Basin.,Despite unprecedented economic growth rates in the Lower Mekong Basin countries over the past decade. the region remains one of the worlds poorest. More than 60 percent of breadwinners in these countries hold occupations related to water. Therefore. rural poor. ethnic minorities. and disadvantaged women. are vulnerable to changes in water availability and accessibility.In recent years. numerous hydropower projects. large-scale land acquisitions for agro-industrial use. tourism infrastructure. mining. and climate change have changed the flow of water in the Lower Mekong Basin. These developments have put pressure on the people whose livelihoods have traditionally depended on use of water resources.The challenge currently facing the Lower Mekong Basin countries is how to support local peoples livelihoods in an changed water use regime. Equitable development. which benefits all water users. will require coordinated responses and cross-border collaboration by all of these countries.The Mekong River Commission (MRC) plays an increasingly important role as the facilitator of inter-governmental cooperation and water-related conflict resolution. The MRC was established as a knowledge-based intergovernmental organization through the. 1995 Agreement. to join the countries of Cambodia. Laos. Thailand and Vietnam together to fulfill a common vision of an economically prosperous. socially just and environmentally sound Mekong River Basin.

To achieve this. the training of competent executives and the development of innovative technologies and approaches are essential. The program aims to contribute to this through an academic partnership between the International Institute of Engineering. Water and the Environment (2iE) and Swiss academic institutions.  ,According to the World Bank. the lack of well-trained technical staff is a key factor in the low level of implementation of projects financed for Sub-Saharan African countries. Added to this are new challenges for Africa such as climatic irregularities (eg drought in the Sahel which alternate with extraordinary floods). the scarcity of accessible energy resources and a high rate of urbanization. Thus. most Sub-Saharan African countries will be absent from the Millennium Development Goals meeting in 2015. To meet the continent&#39;s development challenges. it is necessary to strengthen capacities in priority areas for Africa such as drinking water. sanitation. the environment and renewable energies in order to increase human capital and innovation capacities in Africa.,scientific partnership between ie water management and the development of energy sources accessible to populations are necessary factors to create the conditions for human and sustainable development in africa to achieve this the training of competent executives and the development of innovative technologies and approaches are essential the program aims to contribute to this through an academic partnership between the international institute of engineering water and the environment ie and swiss academic institutions according to the world bank the lack of welltrained technical staff is a key factor in the low level of implementation of projects financed for subsaharan african countries added to this are new challenges for africa such as climatic irregularities eg drought in the sahel which alternate with extraordinary floods the scarcity of accessible energy resources and a high rate of urbanization thus most subsaharan african countries will be absent from the millennium development goals meeting in to meet the continents development challenges it is necessary to strengthen capacities in priority areas for africa such as drinking water sanitation the environment and renewable energies in order to increase human capital and innovation capacities in africa,2iE and its professors through capacity building to provide quality teaching and high-level research/development.

Opportunity for young Swiss people to train in key issues for development. The public and private sectors. NGOs. and development projects will be secondary beneficiaries through the recruitment of 2iE graduates. and the participation of their staff in training programs. The populations of Africa will be indirect beneficiaries through the impact that the program will have on the development of the water. sanitation. energy and environment sectors and in general on the fight against poverty.,2iE has benefited for about 3 decades from EPFL support to develop and conduct postgraduate training and research in the fields of water. sanitation and the environment. This collaboration has helped to create a real scientific culture at 2iE and to train thousands of Africans in these fields who are currently contributing to the development of the continent. 2iE is one of the universities in Africa where all graduates easily find work. The 2iE-EPFL collaboration has been the subject of several evaluations which have concluded with excellent results both from a scientific/academic point of view and in terms of management of the financial resources made available. However. the latest external evaluation notes some critical points related to the evolution of 2iE which has gone from an inter-State organization to a private foundation. The organization has become more efficient but this requires students to pay for their tuition themselves. which penalizes people from poor backgrounds who do not benefit from scholarships provided by their States. The SDC considered that after 30 years of cooperation. it was time to rethink this partnership. on the one hand by moving the decision-making centre from Lausanne to Ouagadougou and on the other hand by opening it up to other Swiss partners who had already established contacts with the 2iE. The introductory phase made it possible to obtain the agreement of all partners on i) the content of the research projects. primarily oriented towards development issues. ii) the cooperation arrangements. taking into account the differences between the institutions involved. iii) the planning and steering documents for the projects and the entire programme.,Component 1: Scientific and technological research and training support: &quot;In the priority research themes of &quot;water and climate change&quot;. &quot;sanitation&quot; and &quot;renewable energy&quot;. scientific research projects relevant to development issues are implemented and young African and Swiss researchers are trained&quot;.

Phase 1,Program for the Development of Economic and Commercial Infrastructure in Benin (P-DIEM) ,The agricultural economic potential of Northeastern Benin remains limited. among other things due to the poor development of local economic infrastructure. This program aims to improve this situation by strengthening local public and private actors in the construction and sustainable management of profitable economic infrastructure. The program provides resources for the co-financing of two local inter-municipal markets and several communal economic infrastructures.  ,In Benin. the agricultural sector contributes a significant share of the GDP. 33% in 2008. after the tertiary sector. It employs ¾ of the working population and provides more than 80% of official export revenues. However. the agricultural economic potential of Benin and more particularly in Borgou and Alibori are poorly valued due to the low level of equipment in economic and commercial infrastructures (IEM). Markets. places of commercial exchanges only represent a quarter of the IEM. mostly made of conventional materials (cement blocks and sheet metal roofing). The investment capacities of local authorities on their own resources remain very insignificant and they do not have the skills to ensure real project management of the IEMs built. There is also a lack of skills at the level of the local private sector (companies. craftsmen). These local skills are nevertheless essential in the construction and management of IEMs in order to generate opportunities for the local private sector.,program for the development of economic and commercial infrastructure in benin pdiem the agricultural economic potential of northeastern benin remains limited among other things due to the poor development of local economic infrastructure this program aims to improve this situation by strengthening local public and private actors in the construction and sustainable management of profitable economic infrastructure the program provides resources for the cofinancing of two local intermunicipal markets and several communal economic infrastructures in benin the agricultural sector contributes a significant share of the gdp in after the tertiary sector it employs ¾ of the working population and provides more than of official export revenues however the agricultural economic potential of benin and more particularly in borgou and alibori are poorly valued due to the low level of equipment in economic and commercial infrastructures iem markets places of commercial exchanges only represent a quarter of the iem mostly made of conventional materials cement blocks and sheet metal roofing the investment capacities of local authorities on their own resources remain very insignificant and they do not have the skills to ensure real project management of the iems built there is also a lack of skills at the level of the local private sector companies craftsmen these local skills are nevertheless essential in the construction and management of iems in order to generate opportunities for the local private sector,The target group is mainly made up of: craftsmen and craftswomen. agricultural producers and small traders in local and intercommunal markets; local authorities (the 14 communes of Borgou and Alibori and the 2 intercommunalities). ,Although this is a first phase. the SDC has significant experience in supporting stakeholders in the construction and management of local infrastructure. In Benin. in 2001. the SDC supported a programme for the development and maintenance of rural roads in Borgou. In Burkina Faso. the SDC has gained highly relevant experience in the Medium-Sized Cities Programme. which has enabled the construction of commercial facilities such as central markets. livestock markets. a slaughterhouse and bus stations. The main lessons learned are: the establishment of commercial infrastructure represents a major asset for stimulating local and regional economic development; the processes of designing. building and operating commercial infrastructure require intensive and very open participatory approaches; support is crucial and based on respect for the pace of partners. local dynamics and relationships between stakeholders on the ground. and is therefore by nature difficult to plan precisely. ,Effect 1  Economic revitalization: The economic and commercial infrastructures built boost markets and trade in local products; Effect 2  Increase in the implementation. management and investment capacities of municipalities: Municipalities and market managers implement and sustainably manage infrastructures and manage to invest more; Effect 3  Boosting local entrepreneurship and promoting local materials: Local entrepreneurship (artisans. small and medium-sized local businesses) provides jobs and generates income thanks to the markets won in the implementation of infrastructures that promote local potential (local materials and green energy).,,The general objective of the DIEM program is rural economic and institutional development in Borgou and Alibori driven by the construction of profitable economic infrastructures.

For a final phase. Switzerland. with co-financing from the Netherlands. is consolidating the achievements in a sustainable manner while supporting the extension to a new region to take into account. in particular. internally displaced persons (IDPs). women and young people affected by the security crisis.  ,Burkina Faso has potential in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) contributing to the food security of the population. Despite this existing potential. most rural households and community NTFP enterprises generate little added value. The food/nutritional situation remains alarming due to the food deficit and low incomes of vulnerable households. With the deterioration in security. which has led to large population movements. livelihoods are further weakened. The resettlement of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in host communities poses socio-economic and environmental problems. Furthermore. climate change is an aggravating factor. causing a reduction in the population of species such as tamarind and baobab. Switzerland&#39;s support in previous phases. affecting more than 120.000 people. has helped improve the food consumption score by 28%. reducing child malnutrition and increasing income by 14% at the level of vulnerable households. Progress in the preservation of natural resources (approx. 10.000 ha secured). and in the processing of NTFP products (shea butter. baobab and moringa) is also encouraging.

In Benin. entrepreneurship is very underdeveloped. which contributes to making this country one of the poorest on the planet. The program aims to promote entrepreneurship of small and medium-sized enterprises through advisory support. training and support for innovation. while respecting certain social. environmental and territorial standards.  ,The general census of Beninese businesses reveals the existence of a total of approximately 138.000 businesses. of which only 27% are located in rural areas. However. rural areas and agriculture still employ more than two-thirds of the population and contribute 36% to the gross domestic product (GDP). The vast majority (&gt;90%) of these businesses are small. underdeveloped and do not employ any permanent salaried employees. These micro-enterprises. using family labor. suffer from limited productivity. This low development of entrepreneurship is a handicap for the creation of jobs and income and for the economic development of the country in general.

The combination of public investment in capacity building (public funds with no return) with private material investment (capital of solidarity investors. funds to be repaid) including personalized links between investors and entrepreneurs constitutes an effective formula in supporting solidarity enterprises given their sustainability. In the context of Benin. the role of intercommunality (association of municipalities) remains essential in the promotion of private solidarity enterprises because a preponderant role is attributed to state structures in territorial economic development.,At least 25 competitive and viable solidarity enterprises (SEs) are successfully developed. leading to the creation of approximately 80 new jobs in four promising sectors. At least 2.500 rural producers (women &gt; 50%) and 500 traditional micro-enterprises (other than rural producers) collaborate with the SEs. creating approximately 420 new jobs and contributing to an improvement in the sustainable incomes of all those involved. The SENS approach to financing and advising solidarity enterprises is consolidated. capitalized on and popularized with a view to dissemination by a local professional team.

Phase 2 (Jul.2016-Dec.2020),Promoting off-farm employment and income in the Great Lakes Region through climate responsive construction material production,High demographic growth in the Great Lakes increases the competition for scarce natural resources and boosts the demand for affordable housing. The project aims at triggering local economic development. improving working conditions and increasing off-farm employment through climate responsive building material production. Results of the first phase allow for a technology transfer adjusted to local needs and scaling up of the brick production value chains in the region.,The regions extreme demographic development creates a high pressure on arable land and natural resources. The fast-growing population consumes more and more fuelwood for cooking and for firing the bricks required for addressing the growing housing demand created by rapid urbanisation. Although the level of urbanisation is still low. the three countries urban agglomerations are growing at high speed. If the trend continues at the current level. the three countries urban population will nearly double by 2024.To protect the remaining forests. the use of firewood in brick making is banned in Rwanda and restricted in Burundi. and DR Congo. Furthermore. governmental programmes in Rwanda seek to promote energy-efficient brick kilns and equipment for alternative building materials production. as well as Rwanda made products.

The overall objective of the project is to improve the rural populations health and livelihood with sustainable safe drinking water and sanitation facilities as well as with the development of training for better household hygienic behavior.  ,In Tajikistan access to safe drinking water is one of the key development challenges. According to estimations. 46% of the rural population does not have access to safe drinking water. About 70% of all infectious diseases are intestinal and most of them are waterborne and related to hygiene.

Since February 2007. 6 villages representing 39.000 people have been supplied with safe drinking water. All the water systems are managed locally by the population (community based management) and 4 out of those 6 villages are interconnected and fed by one single source of safe water. All water associations are registered as legal entities. A full cost recovery tariff is designed for each water system and approved by the population. The regulations for the application of the tariff system take into account poor segments of the population. The collection rate is steadily increasing and slowly reaching the breakeven point fixed at 85% collection rate. An external evaluation conducted in May 2012 concluded that the project was highly relevant due to the critical situation in the water and sanitation sector. that the work of the Water Structures in charge of the management of the water system at village level is particularly effective and efficient and that physical targets were with relatively high cost effectiveness.

Moreover. in the second phase of CORIGAP. a special focus was put on specific social. economic conditions or constraints faced by smallholder men and women farmers as well as on knowledge factors that play a crucial role in the adoption of best practices.,corigap closing rice yield gaps in asia sdc supports the international rice research institute and national research and extension partners in six countries in asia china indonesia myanmar sri lanka thailand vietnam to develop quantitative tools and methods to optimize the sustainability of irrigated systems in order to enhance regional food security while minimizing the environmental footprint of rice production through this contribution switzerland has initiated the development of sustainable rice production indicators which are now adopted by more than private and public organisations rice is the staple food for some billion people worldwide the availability of lowpriced rice is crucial for the food security of million poor people who reside in riceeating countriesthe closing rice yield gaps in asia with reduced environmental footprint corigap project started in with the aim of improving food security and gender equity and alleviating poverty through optimizing productivity and sustainability of irrigated rice production systemsthe practices were integrated to not only increase yield but also increase resourceuse efficiency eg water fertilizer and reduce their related negative environmental impacts eg soil and water pollution water depletion greenhouse gases these changes were then embeded in a framework of sustainable rice value chain upgrading linked to markets and policy guidelines moreover in the second phase of corigap a special focus was put on specific social economic conditions or constraints faced by smallholder men and women farmers as well as on knowledge factors that play a crucial role in the adoption of best practices,Direct:  More than 800000 farmers in the 6 targetted countries.  ,By December 2020. the projects efforts on promoting best management practices for lowland intensive rice reached more than 750.000 farmers across six Asian countries (CORIGAP target was 500.000 by 2020). About 120.000 farmers have adopted best practices and increased their rice yield by 11-20%. and profit by 15-25% (target 125.000 by 2022).In Vietnam. farmers who followed the proposed Best Management Practices; yield were higher than control fields by 0.5 to 1.0 t/ha. pesticide use reduced by 50%. and net income increased by 7-9% in Winter-Spring and 7-18% in Summer-Autumn.The Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP). which is a multi-stakeholder platform with representation from 100 private sector. government.

Switzerland supports the  Ecological Organic Agriculture Initiative  that promotes a viable alternative in Africa to ensure sustainable agricultural development. food and nutrition security of smallholder farmers in an environmentally sustainable manner. thereby contributing towards a more sustainable global food system. ,Ecological organic agriculture has proven to be one of the viable options for sustainable agricultural development for Africa and more sustainable food systems globally. Since 2015. the organic agricultural land in Africa has increased by almost 119.000ha (7%). The increased local and global demand for healthy food products driven by consumers concerns for safe food and environmentally friendly production as well as growing opportunities for domestic and international markets and trade have contributed significantly to the increase in production. There is a growing recognition that organic agriculture plays a significant role in addressing food insecurity. land degradation. poverty and climate change. Evidence presented by the  UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food  also reveals that smallholder farmers can double food production within 3-10 years in critical regions when ecological methods are applied. However. the organic sector is facing challenges like access to technologies. information. inputs. market infrastructures. price information and policy frameworks at national level. While the organic ecological agriculture strategic plan has been endorsed by the African Union as a continental undertaking. so far only few countries have legislations. data monitoring and evaluation systems in place to complement the implementation and progress tracking.,mainstreaming ecological organic agriculture eoa into agricultural systems in africa current agricultural and food systems rely greatly on nonrenewable external inputs impact negatively on soils water biodiversity nutrition and health switzerland supports the ecological organic agriculture initiative that promotes a viable alternative in africa to ensure sustainable agricultural development food and nutrition security of smallholder farmers in an environmentally sustainable manner thereby contributing towards a more sustainable global food system ecological organic agriculture has proven to be one of the viable options for sustainable agricultural development for africa and more sustainable food systems globally since the organic agricultural land in africa has increased by almost ha the increased local and global demand for healthy food products driven by consumers concerns for safe food and environmentally friendly production as well as growing opportunities for domestic and international markets and trade have contributed significantly to the increase in production there is a growing recognition that organic agriculture plays a significant role in addressing food insecurity land degradation poverty and climate change evidence presented by the un special rapporteur on the right to food also reveals that smallholder farmers can double food production within years in critical regions when ecological methods are applied however the organic sector is facing challenges like access to technologies information inputs market infrastructures price information and policy frameworks at national level while the organic ecological agriculture strategic plan has been endorsed by the african union as a continental undertaking so far only few countries have legislations data monitoring and evaluation systems in place to complement the implementation and progress tracking,Africas smallholder farmers and farmers organizations are the main beneficiaries. A special emphasis is given to maximizing the involvement of women and youth as producers. processors. marketers. PhD/MSc trainees. and policy makers. Furthermore. the EOA-Initiative addresses consumers to drive the demand-side.,The external evaluation of Phase I revealed that among project-involved farmers. production of EOA increased by 83% and unit productivity per area increased on average by 37%. while the organic producers registered more than 10% increase in incomes and quality of life improvements.Ecological Organic Agriculture was newly introduced in curricula of formal learning institutions in Ethiopia. Uganda. Tanzania and Senegal.Ethiopia. Uganda. Tanzania. Kenya.

The latter shall allow farmers to increase lastingly their production. hence their incomes and thanks to efficient and sustainable irrigation and agricultural practices.,Tajikistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia with a population of 9 million people. Around 75% (720.000 ha) of arable land is irrigated. but only 515.000 ha are currently in use due to the deterioration of frrigation and drainage infrastructure. waterlogging and salinization. In Tajikistan. most of the water resources are . still managed along administrative and not hydrological boundaries. In such situation. districts and their oblasts do not have a whole picture on the quantity and quality of water resources and the needs of all water users including the needs of environment. Therefore. integrating all water resources and water users within hydrographical basins will help in addressing the growing water needs under the scenario of population growth and climate change. The country is prone to natural disasters. in particular to water related ones. which further impacts agriculture and the water sector. In addition. natural disasters (floods. mudflows etc.). pose a high risk by affecting lives and livelihoods of the people.Lack of financial resources. poor management. old infrastructure etc. creates challenging in effective management of the water system in the country. The old system of water management that used to be centralized and nationally subsidized now needs to be adapted to the modern conditions and realities.

The country regularly faces food insecurity. Seeds are the main input used by farmers. This is why the SDC helps facilitate access to quality seeds that are adapted to their environment. This program allows family farms to improve their production and income and develops self-employment for women and young people through seed multiplication.,Despite its great agricultural potential. the Chadian population remains subject to food insecurity due to low cereal production. Climatic hazards. the organizational and structural deficit of the seed sector. and the unavailability of appropriate inputs and technologies remain the main constraints. However. improved seeds adapted to different contexts alone can increase production by nearly 20% if they are well used. Since 2014. under the impetus of FAO and Swiss cooperation in particular. the legal framework governing the seed sector has been developed: seed law adopted and implementing texts developed and published. At the same time. seed research and multiplication structures have gradually begun to professionalize thanks to the support of various financial partners who are giving increasing importance to the seed sector. Finally. the project is in line with the country&#39;s new strategic orientations. The seed sector is in fact one of the priority themes selected in the National Development Plan (2017-2021) with a view to diversifying and intensifying agricultural production. as well as in the five-year agricultural development plan and the national investment plan for the rural sector in Chad (2016-2022).,operationalization of the seed sector in chad in chad the agricultural production system is rudimentary and yields are low the country regularly faces food insecurity seeds are the main input used by farmers this is why the sdc helps facilitate access to quality seeds that are adapted to their environment this program allows family farms to improve their production and income and develops selfemployment for women and young people through seed multiplication despite its great agricultural potential the chadian population remains subject to food insecurity due to low cereal production climatic hazards the organizational and structural deficit of the seed sector and the unavailability of appropriate inputs and technologies remain the main constraints however improved seeds adapted to different contexts alone can increase production by nearly if they are well used since under the impetus of fao and swiss cooperation in particular the legal framework governing the seed sector has been developed seed law adopted and implementing texts developed and published at the same time seed research and multiplication structures have gradually begun to professionalize thanks to the support of various financial partners who are giving increasing importance to the seed sector finally the project is in line with the countrys new strategic orientations the seed sector is in fact one of the priority themes selected in the national development plan with a view to diversifying and intensifying agricultural production as well as in the fiveyear agricultural development plan and the national investment plan for the rural sector in chad,200.000 family farms in five intervention regions are directly targeted by the program.

Thanks to the capacity building of national institutions in charge of the sector. family farms in other regions of the country will also benefit from the dividends of improved seed quality.,The political and regulatory framework of the seed system has been built and is gradually becoming operational. The Chadian Institute of Agronomic Research for Development (ITRAD) and the Directorate of Seeds and Plants (DSP) have improved the quality of their services: varietal maintenance. production of pre-basic and quality base seeds. inspection and control of seeds in the fields and in the laboratory. The number of seed multipliers has increased fivefold. In 2017. 221 organizations multiplied and produced quality seeds controlled by the Directorate of Seeds and Plants. They were formed into a national federation. More than 4.000 family farms (EF) have had access to quality seeds allowing them to obtain higher yields (8 to 10% better than the previous situation). In terms of lessons learned. the production of quality seeds is still insufficient compared to the country&#39;s needs. Studies have shown that with a modest investment in terms of purchasing quality seeds. production becomes economically profitable. The promulgation of the seed law and the dialogue conducted by the Swiss cooperation office with other donors (EU. WB) has demonstrated a real interest on the part of the latter in financing the seed sector. Co-financing by the DUE is expected at the start of phase 2.,The legal and institutional framework is further clarified and operational and contributes to the development of the sector. ITRAD is strengthened and produces improved seeds controlled by the DSP in response to the needs of multipliers. Private operators. seed producer groups and organizations and entrepreneurs increase their productive capacities and ensure the continuous availability of improved seeds on the market. Family farms improve seed self-production and become pillars of the informal system. Thanks to a dissemination system and support from the National Rural Development Agency (ANADER) and NGOs. 200.000 family farms. or approximately 20% of family farms in the five intervention regions. access and use quality seeds to increase their agricultural production.,Producers. both men and women. are trained on the use of improved seeds to increase agricultural productivity. Private operators sell their production of improved seeds through warehouses. input shops and local or regional fairs. The National Council of Seeds and Plants is set up to assist the government in monitoring the implementation of the national seed policy. The Directorate of Seeds and Plants ensures the implementation of the seed law. A management mechanism. promoting the autonomy of the laboratory. is established. The technical. professional and material capacities of ITRAD are strengthened to enable it to increase its production of basic seeds.,The overall objective of the program is to contribute to food security and increase agricultural production and income of family farms in Moyen Chari.

7F08692,2,0,,Tchad-CA17-PREPAS,Strengthening pastoral livestock farming in Chad (PREPAS),Pastoral livestock farming is a key economic activity in the Sahel-Saharan region. where poverty rates are very high in Chad. However. this way of life is weakened by climatic hazards that cause pastoral crises and early transhumance. which are the source of many conflicts. In order to strengthen the resilience of livestock farmers. the SDC is funding a project that enhances pastoral resources by promoting their access to water. creating transhumance corridors and improving the provision of health services.,Pastoral livestock farming represents more than 80% of Chad&#39;s livestock population. which. according to the latest livestock census in 2016. totals 94 million head of all species. The Batha. Wadi Fira and Ennedi regions. where the SDC operates. are considered areas of excellence for pastoral livestock farming. However. due to irregular rainfall. agropastoralism tends to supplant crops in the Sahelian fringe. These regions regularly face pastoral and food crises. Poverty is becoming endemic. causing a high rate of malnutrition among children. In 2017. herders undertook early transhumance due to the drought. which caused numerous deadly conflicts between herders and farmers. Aware of the importance of pastoral livestock farming and its economic. social and security issues. the government of Chad and its partners have invested in this subsector in recent years. The provision of services. transhumance corridors and access to water points have been improved in particular. However. these advances are still largely insufficient. ,strengthening pastoral livestock farming in chad prepas pastoral livestock farming is a key economic activity in the sahelsaharan region where poverty rates are very high in chad however this way of life is weakened by climatic hazards that cause pastoral crises and early transhumance which are the source of many conflicts in order to strengthen the resilience of livestock farmers the sdc is funding a project that enhances pastoral resources by promoting their access to water creating transhumance corridors and improving the provision of health services pastoral livestock farming represents more than of chads livestock population which according to the latest livestock census in totals million head of all species the batha wadi fira and ennedi regions where the sdc operates are considered areas of excellence for pastoral livestock farming however due to irregular rainfall agropastoralism tends to supplant crops in the sahelian fringe these regions regularly face pastoral and food crises poverty is becoming endemic causing a high rate of malnutrition among children in herders undertook early transhumance due to the drought which caused numerous deadly conflicts between herders and farmers aware of the importance of pastoral livestock farming and its economic social and security issues the government of chad and its partners have invested in this subsector in recent years the provision of services transhumance corridors and access to water points have been improved in particular however these advances are still largely insufficient,The first targets are the breeders of the 3 regions who make a limited transhumance in their region or the neighboring regions. They represent approximately 20.000 households. or approximately 1/10 of the total households (RGPH2. 2009) and affect approximately 200.000 people. The effects of the actions also affect women and young people. who are primarily concerned by the water chore. herding the herd and processing by-products.,The supply of water points in the intervention regions has improved by 7% thanks to the construction and/or rehabilitation of 60 wells as well as the construction of around ten ponds. This access to water has enabled the opening and development of new pastoral areas. The foundations for conflict prevention and management during transhumance have been laid with the marking of 300 km of corridors and the definition of more than 180 social agreements. The breeders are organized into groups. which manage veterinary pharmacies and/or livestock feed stores providing local services. These structures have been of capital importance during the lean periods and pastoral crises of the last two years. These organizations participated in the development of regional development plans by defending the needs of breeders. Women from 13 women&#39;s groups developed income-generating activities through sheep fattening. meat or milk processing and joined the decision-making bodies of community mechanisms for facilitating access to veterinary services and food supplements. The experience of phase 1 showed that studies and agreements prior to the construction of infrastructure are essential conditions for preventing conflicts. Also. differentiated support is needed between actors located around urban centers and those in camps that are isolated and on the fringes of all services; for the latter. strategies must be adapted to their dispersion and mobility. Finally. in view of the difficulties encountered in public veterinary product services. it seemed wise to establish a mechanism. similar to health management committees. with the involvement of beneficiaries to strengthen social control.,Animal mobility along transhumance routes and in rangeland and attachment areas is secured. conflict prevention and management are improved and resources are better managed. ensuring less conflictual access to pastoral resources and the preservation of livestock capital. Livestock farmers have improved the productivity of their livestock and their food security through the development of local services and economic initiatives implemented by professional livestock farmers&#39; organizations (OPE). Access to single health services (human and animal) is improved in marginalized pastoral areas far from urban centers. in conjunction with access to local animal health services in areas closer to the centers.,Access to water is improved (construction of hydraulic structures) in pastoral areas and pastoral and water resources are better managed. The mobility of animals along transhumance routes is secured through the marking of corridors and the concerted prevention/management of conflicts. Breeders are organized to facilitate access to products and local services for as many people as possible. Vulnerable populations (women and young people) are strengthened in their economic activities (processing. trade). Private and public veterinary services are strengthened and breeders have local animal health services. Breeders located in areas furthest from urban centers have access to a single pilot health service (human and animal).,The overall objective of the program is to improve the living conditions and food security of pastoral populations in the Ennedi.

Wadi Fira and Ennedi are Sahelian provinces subject to the advance of the desert and irregular rainfall. Pastoral livestock farming is the main economic activity there. Switzerland supports a program to strengthen pastoral livestock farming that contributes to sustainable resource management. conflict prevention and improving the provision of services to livestock farmers. This program provides economic opportunities for young people. limiting migration to Libya or gold-mining areas marked by insecurity and banditry.,Batha. Wadi Fira and Ennedi West are pastoral provinces. concentrating more than ¼ of Chad&#39;s livestock. Located on the edge of the Sahara and the Sahel. these provinces suffer from a deficit and irregular rainfall. Animals drink from the rare water points available. sometimes leading to an overload on certain parts of the already fragile lands. These regions located between 700 and 1.500 km from N&#39;Djamena also suffer from the weakness of the State. basic social services are lacking. The indicators are among the lowest in Chad (e.g. the rate of access to water is 5% when the national average is around 62%). Young people drop out of middle and high schools to accompany men looking for gold in Libya. In the absence of results. some turn to drug trafficking. even mercenaries or armed struggle. Very few development projects are funded by donors. As part of its cooperation strategy. Switzerland is implementing programs for &quot;Runoff Water Management&quot; and Strengthening Pastoral Livestock Farming. which contribute to adaptation to climate change through the rehabilitation and protection of pastoral areas. the promotion and development of economic opportunities and the improvement of living and working conditions for livestock farmers; and thus contribute to the preservation of peace and security. ,prepas program for strengthening pastoral livestock farming in chad batha wadi fira and ennedi are sahelian provinces subject to the advance of the desert and irregular rainfall pastoral livestock farming is the main economic activity there switzerland supports a program to strengthen pastoral livestock farming that contributes to sustainable resource management conflict prevention and improving the provision of services to livestock farmers this program provides economic opportunities for young people limiting migration to libya or goldmining areas marked by insecurity and banditry batha wadi fira and ennedi west are pastoral provinces concentrating more than ¼ of chads livestock located on the edge of the sahara and the sahel these provinces suffer from a deficit and irregular rainfall animals drink from the rare water points available sometimes leading to an overload on certain parts of the already fragile lands these regions located between and km from ndjamena also suffer from the weakness of the state basic social services are lacking the indicators are among the lowest in chad eg the rate of access to water is when the national average is around young people drop out of middle and high schools to accompany men looking for gold in libya in the absence of results some turn to drug trafficking even mercenaries or armed struggle very few development projects are funded by donors as part of its cooperation strategy switzerland is implementing programs for quotrunoff water managementquot and strengthening pastoral livestock farming which contribute to adaptation to climate change through the rehabilitation and protection of pastoral areas the promotion and development of economic opportunities and the improvement of living and working conditions for livestock farmers and thus contribute to the preservation of peace and security,The final beneficiaries of the program are mainly small breeders. who spend most of the year in their land and have limited mobility. women for the development of generating activities and young entrepreneurs/promoters in the livestock sector.  , The construction and rehabilitation of 78 pastoral wells. 15 ponds and 685 km of corridors has provided better access to water for more than 150.000 households and the opening of more than 7.000 km2 of new grazing areas. This has helped to reduce animal losses. reduce travel distances. delay early descent to agricultural areas by around 3 months. and thus sustainably prevent conflicts related to straying/destruction of fields in these regions. The membership rate of breeders in the unions has increased by 15% (compared to 18% expected). Some communities not affected by the project have created. by referring to the first unions. on their own initiative. their own mechanism for supplying veterinary inputs and/or livestock feed. The services offered by the organizations are appreciated by the 3.173 members (including 1.635 women). The animal loss rate is reduced from more than 11% to 5% (expected target 7%). Thanks to income-generating activities. women members of the organizations have saved or invested in small ruminants an average of CHF 380 per campaign and have created literacy centers. The single health pilot action (human and animal) has been launched. this innovative system is based on the decentralized systems of the state. Support for vaccination campaigns has made it possible to reach more than 579.000 heads of cattle (450.000 planned). Breeders are increasingly relying on the products of their unions that they use and on decentralized livestock services., Livestock Sector Governance is improved and the needs of livestock farmers are better considered in discussions/plans/strategies at local. provincial and national levels. Public and private service providers improve livestock farmers&#39; access to basic social services (health. drinking water. education). Access to natural resources and securing mobility are strengthened and managed in a concerted manner by beneficiaries. The range of economic opportunities in livestock farming is expanded and offers better services and additional income., The network of livestock organizations is expanded and strengthened to assume its role as a voice for livestock farmers and for advocacy. The ministries in charge of livestock and water are supported to better support pastoralism. take into account the expectations and needs of livestock farmers and coordinate interventions in the livestock sector. Private entrepreneurship (individual. cooperative) engaged in pastoral activities in the livestock farmers&#39; land is supported to improve the provision of services to livestock farmers. A unique adapted health system (human and animal) is promoted and operational in pastoral areas far from urban centers.

Most Cambodian farmers are smallholders with less than two hectares per household. Cambodian smallholder agriculture substantially relies on female farmers. Women's contribution to food production is about 65% of agricultural labour. However. they face greater constraints in accessing productive resources than men. Currently. approximately 90% of fresh fruits and vegetables consumed in Cambodia are imported from Thailand and Vietnam.

The SDC mandated programme supports poor. smallholder women and men farmers to increase their productivity and income and to improve food security. nutrition and climate resilience.,Agriculture remains an important economic sector in Cambodia. providing 29% of GDP and employment for 53% of the rural workforce. Some 90% of poor people live in rural areas and many are smallholder farmers with less than two hectares of farmland per household. Approximately 19% of the rural population is vulnerable to falling back into poverty due to external social and economic shocks. including natural disasters and scarcity of water resources as a consequence of climate change. especially in the highlands of the north-eastern part of the country (SDC target area). With more than 65% of Cambodian women engaged in farming. women-headed households and children (30% malnutrition rate) are the most vulnerable.Increases in small farmers productivity and the shift from subsistence farming into commercial farming are key policy aims of the Government.

The potential market is approximately one million farms. In synergy with the Swiss portfolio programs in the South and Grand-Anse. 20.000 farms will be directly affected over 5 years. ,Mid-term and external evaluations of the first phase of PAPAH noted the complexity of its structure and convinced the embassy of the interest in separating it into three specific programs. The sub-component on agricultural financing enabled the mobilization of the private sector around agricultural financing. The professionalization of the offer and the establishment of a loan guarantee mechanism allowed the agricultural credit portfolio to reach 3.06% of the overall outstanding amount of public and private financial institutions as of December 31. 2018; it represented less than 1% at the start of the project. Phase 1 was also an opportunity for a public-private committee to agree on the conditions required to initiate public-private partnerships capable of sustainably supporting the crop insurance distribution system. Phase 1 made it possible to verify that the receptiveness of the private sector to agricultural financing in public-private partnership mode is based first and foremost on a tangible commitment from the State to support its development. It made it possible to lay the solid foundations that justify our desire to contribute to this initiative led by a State actor. This change in the mode of contribution tends towards increased support for development by the country&#39;s key actors.

Most countries in Southern Africa face serious challenges to address the crisis. including shortages of key health workers to deliver quality care and treatment to HIV patients. The poor and unstable economic environment leads to a brain drain of qualified healthcare personnel. This is coupled with inadequate resources by the governments to ensure public health institutions have the necessary resources to provide quality services to the poor. as well as unforeseen climate related events that undermine HIV prevention and treatment efforts. Whilst the quality of services is relatively good in the private sector. it is completely out of the reach to the wider population.

One consequence of a new rural economy in which the private sector plays an increasingly larger role is a need for a new kind of agricultural extension.Rather than instructing farmers in basic techniques or providing production inputs such as seeds. extension services must now help farmers organize. develop their businesses. negotiate with the private sector and adopt environmentally sustainable practices. These changing needs also imply a shift toward service delivery by actors other than the government.The need for pluralism in extension service provision is fully acknowledged and promoted by the Lao Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.In particular. the Department for Agricultural Extension and Cooperatives (DAEC) recognizes the growing importance of the private sector. farmer organizations and non-profit associations as agricultural extension service providers.,lao upland rural advisory service luras the swiss agency for development and cooperation sdc is supporting the lao governments agriculture and food security programs since more than a decade lao pdr is a nation of smallholder farmers with over of the workforce employed in the agriculture sector during the past two decades impressive improvements in agricultural production have been achieved which has contributed to declining poverty ratesyet part of the lao population is still prone to poverty this is especially true for farmers in rural areas femaleheaded households and ethnic minority members these groups are challenged by the ongoing shift from sustenance to commercial agriculture increasing competition over land and other resources and a rapidly growing number of private sector actors in agriculturefarmers organizations which can help equip their members to better navigate the commercial market and otherwise enhance their businesses are beginning to emerge and are further adding to the complexity one consequence of a new rural economy in which the private sector plays an increasingly larger role is a need for a new kind of agricultural extensionrather than instructing farmers in basic techniques or providing production inputs such as seeds extension services must now help farmers organize develop their businesses negotiate with the private sector and adopt environmentally sustainable practices these changing needs also imply a shift toward service delivery by actors other than the governmentthe need for pluralism in extension service provision is fully acknowledged and promoted by the lao ministry of agriculture and forestryin particular the department for agricultural extension and cooperatives daec recognizes the growing importance of the private sector farmer organizations and nonprofit associations as agricultural extension service providers,,,,Advisory services are delivered to small farmers in selected upland areas. particularly to women and ethnic minorities. to achieve better production result.Farmer Organizations have been established and strengthened that expedite engagement in value chains among small producers in the upland.Through farmer organizations and networks. the voice of small producers has been raised. demands for services expressed and bargaining power enhanced.Sustainable and fair service delivery models by private sector actors have been expanded.Policy makers. planners and managers related to upland agriculture have access to the necessary information to that enables decisions toward an agribusiness code of conduct.   ,The Swiss Cooperation in the Mekong Region supports the Lao Upland Rural Advisory (LURAS) project to facilitate an effective demand-driven pluralistic extension service delivery system in Lao PDR.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) recognizes that greater pluralism in service provision is needed. LURAS supports a multi-stakeholder market-based approach to promote demand-driven service provision to farmers and strengthen the capacities of farmers organizations.,In Lao PDR. impressive changes in agricultural production occurred over the past two decades. Thanks to infrastructure improvements and market development. smallholder farmers are in contact with a much wider range of service providers and have access to information from a growing number of traders and media. Emerging farmer organisa­tions have gathered to create a network at national level. seeking for a better positioning towards the private sector and for government recognition.

The project will support the Ministry of Education to establish a National Vocational Qualifications Framework and a corresponding NVQ Authority to manage it. Learners and workers. especially from disadvantaged groups. will benefit from an improved vocational training qualification and skills certification system. thus increasing their chances for sustainable and decent employment. ,Every year 500000 youths enter the labour market. 80% of whom are unskilled. have not finished high school and are thus denied equal opportunities in the employment system. In the absence of available formal vocational training. many youths work as unskilled labourers. remain un- or underemployed or choose to migrate for better employment. Those who are employed acquire skills through informal training beforehand or on the job. Against this background. skills testing offers candidates an assessment and official certification of competencies. irrespective of where and how these competencies were gained.  Through the National Skill Testing Board (NSTB). a system of vocational qualifications is emerging.

It allows the expansion of effective drought resilience experience in Afar into the Somali Regional State of Ethiopia. GIZ and the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture will pilot and document natural resources rehabilitation and livelihood improvement measures through participatory approaches. addressing the priority concerns of local pastoralist populations.,Pastoralists. whose livlihoods largely depend on livestock production. occupy most of the drylands of the Horn of Africa. The Somali Regional State (SRS) has an estimated population of about 4.5 million (mostly pastoralists). 85% of which live in rural areas. Small scale irrigated agriculture along river basins and rain-fed agriculture play a modest role as complementary income and nutrition sources. Advancing natural resources degradation. as a result of growing human and livestock pressure and the weakening of traditional natural resources management systems. has exposed these areas to increased vulnerability to both natural and manmade disasters. The drylands are affected by recurrent drought crisis. that of 2011 having been the worst in 60 years. As a result. grazing resources have been severely degraded.  becoming less productive and encroached by invasive unpalatable weed species. The absence of efficient early warning systems. poor infrastructure. limited access to markets as well as basic animal and human health services. have further exacerbated the decline or collapse of resilience mechanisms to drought and other shocks. In line with a regional commitment to end drought emergencies and build resilience under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority for Development. the Ethiopian Government has developed a Country Programming Paper and issued a new Disaster Risk Management Strategy.

Ethiopia (SDR - SNRS),Pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihoods in Ethiopia's Somali National Regional State (SNRS) are increasingly threatened by environmental (climatic) changes and land degradation. GIZ along with Local Government partners aims at building the resilience of vulnerable pastoralist communities through proven land rehabilitation measures. the promotion of livelihood activities and capacity development of government and private sector institutions.,Pastoralism is now recognised in Ethiopia as the most efficient way of using rangeland resources. contributing to the national economy. However. pastoralist and agropastoralist livelihoods in the Ethiopia's Somali Region are increasingly threatened by environmental (climatic). socio-economic and political changes. leading to drastic increase and vulnerability to droughts. Natural resources degradation is further reducing the availability of pasture and water. While the degradation of natural resources affect all members of the households. women are more affected than men as women's household responsibilities require more time and energy than before. Government agencies in charge of development have insufficient capacities to identify and implement appropriate longerterm solutions. and past interventions to improve communities' resilience have not yet been successful on an appreciable scale. Appropriate interventions such as participatory natural resources management. capacity development. and evidence-based policy advocacy are thus needed. Switzerland is well positioned to address these challenges due to its long-term commitment. its experience in linking humanitarian and development approaches and its focus on empowering local government authorities.

However. previous interventions of SDC and other partners show that considerable improvements are achievable in terms of productivity. diversification and outreach to farmers-including from disadvantaged groups. This is possible by increasing the technical and organisational capacity. coordination and approach of public and private providers of agricultural extension and research. such as the Nepal Agriculture Research Council (NARC).

SDCs contribution to the Somalia Resilience Programme Consortium (SomReP) enables pastoral. agro-pastoral and peri-urban poor to increase their ability to prepare for. adapt to and live through shocks without eroding their productivity or assets. This intervention focuses on capacity building. livelihood diversification and the elaboration of community-based early warning systems and is complementary to ongoing shorter term emergency and longer term development interventions across the Region.  ,Somalia has an arid to semi-arid climate and the country experiences recurring drought every 3-5 years. The drought of 2011 resulted into many deaths and exposed weaknesses in the existing coping mechanisms. including weak human and institutional capacity. lack of effective policies. rules. regulations and legislative arrangements. In addition. consequences resulting from the endemic conflict and insecurity including the forced evictions and displacements have all contributed to undermine the communities resilience.

7F09031,1,0,,Phase 01 More coffee with less water***,Growing more coffee with less water in Vietnam,Growing coffee consumes vast quantities of water. In Vietnam. there are sometimes water shortages in the villages surrounding the plantations. The SDC is working with the Vietnamese authorities and food company Nestlé to encourage local coffee growers to optimise their water use.  ,Vietnam is the world's leading Robusta coffee exporter. Irrigation is a pre-condition in Vietnam to make coffee farming an economically viable livelihood activity for the 500000 smallholder farmers. However. water is scarce during the dry season and farmers tend to irrigate up to two times more than the official recommendations suggest. This situation is aggravated by  the absence of a systematic monitoring of water resources. which makes it impossible to provide information on the condition of water resources and to recommend a course of action on water resources management. This proposal suggests a variety of interventions to improve water productivity and efficiency. reduce water consumption and engage in water policy formulation in an innovative project stakeholder setting.,growing more coffee with less water in vietnam growing coffee consumes vast quantities of water in vietnam there are sometimes water shortages in the villages surrounding the plantations the sdc is working with the vietnamese authorities and food company nestlé to encourage local coffee growers to optimise their water use vietnam is the worlds leading robusta coffee exporter irrigation is a precondition in vietnam to make coffee farming an economically viable livelihood activity for the smallholder farmers however water is scarce during the dry season and farmers tend to irrigate up to two times more than the official recommendations suggest this situation is aggravated by the absence of a systematic monitoring of water resources which makes it impossible to provide information on the condition of water resources and to recommend a course of action on water resources management this proposal suggests a variety of interventions to improve water productivity and efficiency reduce water consumption and engage in water policy formulation in an innovative project stakeholder setting,Direct Beneficiaries:50.000 of the poorer and marginalized coffee farming households with limited access to know-how will receive training on Good Agricultural Practices including water management. There is a potential outreach to 500.000 coffee farming households or 2 million beneficiaries.Indirect Beneficiaries:Given that 50.000 households optimize their irrigation management. this would release additional   water resources for an annual household consumption of around 650.000 water users in Vietnam (12% of the Central Highlands population). Optimization of water use in the coffee sector will spare water for other uses. such as domestic water use. other water users in agriculture (e.g. rice. pepper. cocoa farming) and industry (e.g. wet coffee processing). as well as for power generation (hydro-power).,The water footprint for Robusta coffee production in Vietnam is known.Risks of water availability and the needs for improved water resources management for coffee production in Vietnam are widely disseminated and recognized at national and international level.Partnerships and momentum have been generated to elaborate further on integrated water management and rational water use in the Central Highlands of Vietnam.,Outcome 1: Water resources management is improved.Outcome 2:  A weather early warning system supports optimization of coffee farm management.Outcome 3: Scaling up through farmer trainings and policy advocacy.Outcome 4: Global policy makers are sensitized through the results of the project.,Water availability. supply and demand have been inventoried in the Dak Lak province. Water scarce hotspots have been identified and Water Action Plans have been formulated. implemented and monitored for 2 pilot micro-catchments by local institutions in partnership with and through capacity building support from selected international institutions. Annual reports on water application versus  water productivity. broken down per agro-climatic region.Final scientific report summarizing the long-term quantitative results broken down per agro-climatic region.A weather early warning system has been designed. tested and implemented for one Central Highlands province in order to support optimization of farm management.Training: 125 extension officers trained (25 per coffee producing province); 125 extension officers have trained 10.000 farmersper year; 50 demo plots established. ,The overall goal of this project is to ensure equitable and sufficient water availability for all water users in the Central Highlands of Vietnam and to obtain pivotal water savings through improved irrigation management in the coffee sector. Also. the project aims to reach out to a critical mass of farmers. and hence to improve people's livelihoods in socio-economic terms and to protectthe environment.

The SDC has taken various measures to improve their food security and their resilience to crisis situations. ranging from the rehabilitation of pastureland and water points to the introduction of land use plans and the diversification of income sources for women.,Ethiopias livestock sub-sector contributes to about 47% of the agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP). to more than 20% of the total GDP. and to 13% of national exports. Livestock is the key determinant of food security for pastoralists. While pastoralist areas cover 60% of the countrys land mass. their specific needs are insufficiently addressed by national laws and policies. Arable agriculture. which has better defined rules and regulations overall. often overshadows pastoralism. in a context where the peripheral lowlands have been historically side-lined by the central Government. These realities  alongside socio-economic. environmental. and institutional challenges  have increased the vulnerability of pastoralist communities overall. particularly in the Borana Zone of the Oromia National Regional State. where rangeland productivity has significantly dwindled in recent years mainly due to advancing bush encroachment. overgrazing. soil erosion. inappropriate and poor quality water developments. demographic pressure. recurrent drought and the weakening of traditional rangeland management systems. Other factors contributing to the weakening of pastoralist livelihoods are competing land uses (grazing vs. farming). the increased incidence of resource-based conflicts. a high prevalence of livestock diseases. and a Government strategy to foster sedentarization for an easier availing of social services. With such challenges. an increasing number of Borana pastoralists are poorer today than two decades ago. as reflected by a major decline in cattle holdings per household.

Switzerland intends to support the State in improving the framework conditions conducive to local governance and in strengthening local authorities in order to ensure the delivery of quality public services to the population and thus contribute to the stability of Niger.  ,After 17 years of implementing the decentralization reform. Niger&#39;s local authorities are still not able to provide all local services to their population. This situation is due in particular to the fact that these communities do not have the necessary autonomy or the transfer of financial resources from the State to enable them to exercise their new powers. The context of recurring crises and growing insecurity also gives rise to new challenges to be taken into account. An evaluation of the decentralization process initiated in 2019 by the government. and supported by Switzerland. noted significant achievements in at least 3 transferred sectors (education-hydraulics-health) with municipal and regional authorities increasingly establishing themselves as partners of the State and external actors (in place of customary entities). The renewal of many elected officials following the local elections in December 2020 and the development of a national decentralization action plan for the next 10 years create opportunities to consolidate decentralization.   ,local authorities support program pact despite substantial progress the ongoing reforms related to decentralization in niger are being slowed down in their effective implementation by a lack of human and financial resources switzerland intends to support the state in improving the framework conditions conducive to local governance and in strengthening local authorities in order to ensure the delivery of quality public services to the population and thus contribute to the stability of niger after years of implementing the decentralization reform nigers local authorities are still not able to provide all local services to their population this situation is due in particular to the fact that these communities do not have the necessary autonomy or the transfer of financial resources from the state to enable them to exercise their new powers the context of recurring crises and growing insecurity also gives rise to new challenges to be taken into account an evaluation of the decentralization process initiated in by the government and supported by switzerland noted significant achievements in at least transferred sectors educationhydraulicshealth with municipal and regional authorities increasingly establishing themselves as partners of the state and external actors in place of customary entities the renewal of many elected officials following the local elections in december and the development of a national decentralization action plan for the next years create opportunities to consolidate decentralization,- The local authorities (regions and municipalities) of the Maradi and Dosso Regions - The populations of the two regions including the most vulnerable people (displaced people. migrants. refugees. poor people) i.e. more than 7 million people in 2020 (1/3 of the country),- citizens interact more with local administrations and elected officials (72 public debates organized. 39 citizen monitoring structures set up. 142 accountability exercises conducted). - At the level of local authorities. improvement of the coordination of local and regional development and the mobilization of tax resources (30% in municipalities). - The administrative and financial management capacities of approximately 3.000 elected officials and technical staff have been improved in 37 communities. - Economic infrastructure promoting local/regional development created (4 markets and a slaughterhouse built. 200 km of tracks rehabilitated). - 94 social service infrastructures completed (health centers. classrooms. hydraulic and sanitation works).- The National Agency for Financing Local Authorities (ANFICT) became operational with the decisive support of Switzerland. the first partner to align itself with national procedures.- Improved national legal and institutional framework (e.g. adoption of a key law on human resources of local authorities) - Support to the government for the revision of the decentralization policy (&quot;act 2 decentralization&quot;). which will address the shortcomings and give new momentum to decentralization. ,Outcome 1: High-performance local authorities.

In light of its long-standing expertise in TVET and federalism. Switzerland is well placed to support the implementation of a federalised TVET system that responds to the needs of enterprises and increases the prospect of gainful employment for all. especially youths. ,Whilst Nepals constitution highlights employment as a fundamental right. nearly 1 million youth out of the countrys total labour force of 7.99 million were unemployed in 2019 and at least a third of the employed labour force was underemployed. This is further exacerbated by the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak which doubled unemployment rates according to the International Labour Organisation and resulted into thousands of Nepalese losing their jobs in domestic and international labour markets.The Government of Nepal recognises the TVET system as a crucial instrument to achieve the goal of economic prosperity. This is reflected in the country´s fifteenth periodic plan. which aims to provide dignified and productive employment for all Nepalese citizens. Recently. steps have been taken in the on-going finalisation of the TVET Act to clarify the roles of the three tiers of government in the implementation of a federalised TVET sector. where the federal government will take on a coordination role. whilst provincial and local governments will hold implementation responsibilities.In this pivotal moment for the TVET sector. this phase will support the institutionalisation and implementation of a federalised TVET sector. building on the foundations of phase 1.

The SDC wishes to enhance the immense potential of livestock farming by strengthening the value chain approach oriented towards the development of markets and private sector stakeholders. promoting the consideration of the poor. women and young people.,Mali&#39;s economy is primarily agricultural. 80% of the active population works in this sector. which represented 36% of GDP in 2000 and even 40% in 2014. However. agricultural production is low. suffering from a lack of infrastructure in rural areas and low yields that are too closely linked to climate variations. Although herd productivity is low. as is the creation of added value. livestock farming contributes 19% to the gross domestic product and constitutes a significant source of subsistence for 80% of the population. In addition to the political and security situation. climate change is severely affecting the livestock sector in Mali. The multitude and frequency of conflicts over access to and control of natural resources and the weak organization of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists exacerbate this situation. The main challenges of livestock farming concern the development of infrastructure and equipment. capacity building and professionalization of stakeholders. securing livestock mobility with access to and management of natural resources. orientation and access to the market and social and gender inequalities within (agro-)pastoral societies.,support program for the livestock sector in mali pasem despite its importance in the economy the environment and agropastoral societies livestock farming faces several constraints including low productivity land insecurity weak organization of stakeholders and a form of social marginalization of livestock farmers the sdc wishes to enhance the immense potential of livestock farming by strengthening the value chain approach oriented towards the development of markets and private sector stakeholders promoting the consideration of the poor women and young people malis economy is primarily agricultural of the active population works in this sector which represented of gdp in and even in however agricultural production is low suffering from a lack of infrastructure in rural areas and low yields that are too closely linked to climate variations although herd productivity is low as is the creation of added value livestock farming contributes to the gross domestic product and constitutes a significant source of subsistence for of the population in addition to the political and security situation climate change is severely affecting the livestock sector in mali the multitude and frequency of conflicts over access to and control of natural resources and the weak organization of pastoralists and agropastoralists exacerbate this situation the main challenges of livestock farming concern the development of infrastructure and equipment capacity building and professionalization of stakeholders securing livestock mobility with access to and management of natural resources orientation and access to the market and social and gender inequalities within agropastoral societies,Individual pastoralists and agro-pastoralists (women. men and young people)Organizations of pastoralists/pastoralists and other stakeholders in the milk and livestock-meat sectors (fattening. product processing. etc.)Pastoral farms and businessesRural and peri-urban entrepreneurshipLocal authoritiesDecentralized technical services,SDC support in the livestock sub-sector has focused on pilot actions.

In line with the National Water Policy framework and capitalizing on SDCs experience in the sector. the project aims at strengthening provincial water institutions to enhance water policy development and water service delivery to vulnerable communities in KP. ,With a poverty index of 49%. the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (KP) is increase-ingly committed to implement a pro-poor and people centred reform agenda in order to better respond to the demand of basic water and sanitation services. The current institutional set-up and the poor performances of the public services in water and sanitation. however. create a barrier for the Government of KP to fulfil its mandate. The water sector in KP is fragmented with absence of institutional mechanisms to coordinate a comprehensive sector growth. The lack of coordination between stakeholders has led to inefficient water use. wastage of surface water and indiscriminate abstraction of groundwater resources. Access to piped water is only 35%[1] due to poor structure of service delivery institutions. The prevailing situation has further marginalised poor disadvantaged communities in the provision of water as their basic right. Within the backdrop of socio-political instability. the project has been developed in close consultation with the Government of KP to enhance service delivery leading to social resilience. to mitigate any potential conflicts arising from unequal distribution of water resources and to strengthen institutions for sustainable management of water in the province.[1] Pakistan Social and Livelihood Measurement (PSLM).

7F09333,1,0,,Geneva Water Hub 2023-2027 Phase 1,Contribution to the Geneva Water Hub (2023-2027),Globally. access to fresh water resources are dwindling due to growing demand. increasing pollution and climate change. The Geneva Water Hub. co-hosted by the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute. is an international center of competence for transboundary water resources management. Through research. education. advocacy and mediation. the Hub addresses water insecurity in water scarce regions. helps to prevent water conflicts and contributes to peace. stability and sustainable development.   ,The United Nations World Water Development Report 2023 shows that whilst fresh water use has been increasing globally by roughly 1% per year over the last 40 years (population growth and consumption patterns). water scarcity is becoming endemic in many regions as a result of demographic growth. climate change and water pollution. At current rates. progress towards all the targets of SDG 6 (drinking water and sanitation) is significantly off-track and in some areas the rate of implementation needs to quadruple. By 2050. an estimated 40% of the global population will live in regions under constant water stress. In 2017. water scarcity was the key driver of conflict in 45 countries. primarily in the Middle East. Central Asia and in Africa. Water crises do not always involve a physical shortage of water. but are instead the result of poor. unfair or uncoordinated water management. namely governance issues. It is recognised that strong institutions and water diplomacy efforts can mitigate the potential of conflicts caused by competition over scarce water resources.

Based on initial achievements and lessons learned from phase one.

The geographical scope expands to 20 new remote villages and targets women. men and children.,The economic growth in Lao PDR has contributed to lowering the number of poor people dramatically. Between 2012 and 2017 there was an 11% reduction in stunting. a 6% reduction in underweight prevalence with a 3% increase in wasting[1]. However. children suffering from malnutrition is still high. The ongoing Covid19 crisis might worsen this situation. The Governments National Nutrition Strategy (2015-2025) and Plan of Action (2016-2020) has adopted a multi-sectoral convergence approach to address malnutrition by proposing a combination of supply-side and demand-side interventions. While a lot of progress has been made at the national level on understanding the problem of malnutrition. along with developing policies and plans to address it. less progress has been made in implementation of those plans at provincial. district and community level.

Pastoralists 2015-25,Kenya resilient arid lands partnerships for integrated development (Kenya RAPID),Pastoralism is a millennia old livelihood strategy adapted to the marginal and harsh environments of the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL). This programme supports the historically marginalized pastoralist communities of Northern Kenya. bordering Somalia and Ethiopia. with improved access to water (for both livestock and domestic use) and improved rangelands management through water infrastructure. strengthened public and private institutions and policy frameworks. ,Kenyas ASALs occupy more than 80% of the countrys landmass and are home to 10 million people. The inhabitants are predominantly (agro-) pastoralists (70%). living in a region with the lowest development indicators in Kenya and with over 60% living in poverty. Negative impacts on pastoralist livelihoods and production systems include marginalization by a centralized state (before the introduction of devolved system of governance in 2013). the lack of investments in education and infrastructure for socio-economic development especially in water and rangelands. and recurrent droughts increasing in number and severity due to climate change. Between 2013 to 2015 SDC supported Northern Kenyas pastoralists through the Water for Livestock Project which improved the access of livestock to water and better managed rangeland. Building on the success and lessons learnt of the project. a major project reorientation was done that resulted in the Kenya Resilient Arid Lands Partnerships Programme for Integrated Development (Kenya-RAPID) - a joint longer term and multi-partnership development programme with the private sector. the Millennium Water Alliance. Aqua for All. and USAID. [1]  [1]The Water for Livestock Project was implemented by the HA and funded through additional credit 0.5% GDP in 2013-15.

To this end. the project pilots a three-pronged. community­ based approach. combining water harvesting. conjunctive use of groundwater. and solar power for lifting irrigation water.  ,Jordan. a water scarce country. has an estimated renewable water resource of 148m3 per capita per year. Scarcity is driven primarily by its arid to semi-arid climatic regime and by population increases experienced in recent decades as a result of both natural growth and recent immigration/refugee intake from the crisis in Syria. Of all its water resources. the status of the groundwater is of critical concern because its use requires careful planning and management to sustain human socio-economic development and ecosystems. Yet. groundwater resources are under the threat from mismanagement and over-exploitation. linked in particular to the expansion of irrigated agriculture. Agriculture in Jordan accounts for almost 60% of freshwater withdrawals. making it the largest user of water. placing the greatest pressure on groundwater resources. Agriculture also consumes energy. typically for pumping water from wells and pushing water through irrigation systems. Yet. energy supply poses challenges because of the lack of local energy resources and high demand. Moreover. the use of water and energy in agriculture are inter-linked which means that increased demand or pressure in any one sector has flow-on effects in the others. Nevertheless. agriculture supports a large number of livelihoods in Jordan. particularly in rural areas.,reduce vulnerability in jordan in the context of water scarcity and increasing foodenergy demand the rationale of this project is to reduce vulnerability of rural jordanian and other disadvantaged communities in the context of water scarcity for agriculture increased demand for food and livelihood provision from growing populations and rising energy demand to this end the project pilots a threepronged community based approach combining water harvesting conjunctive use of groundwater and solar power for lifting irrigation water jordan a water scarce country has an estimated renewable water resource of m per capita per year scarcity is driven primarily by its arid to semiarid climatic regime and by population increases experienced in recent decades as a result of both natural growth and recent immigrationrefugee intake from the crisis in syria of all its water resources the status of the groundwater is of critical concern because its use requires careful planning and management to sustain human socioeconomic development and ecosystems yet groundwater resources are under the threat from mismanagement and overexploitation linked in particular to the expansion of irrigated agriculture agriculture in jordan accounts for almost of freshwater withdrawals making it the largest user of water placing the greatest pressure on groundwater resources agriculture also consumes energy typically for pumping water from wells and pushing water through irrigation systems yet energy supply poses challenges because of the lack of local energy resources and high demand moreover the use of water and energy in agriculture are interlinked which means that increased demand or pressure in any one sector has flowon effects in the others nevertheless agriculture supports a large number of livelihoods in jordan particularly in rural areas,Beneficiaries include the communities of small- scale farmers and family farmers who will benefit from increased yields through the increased reliability in their water supply through surface water and groundwater availability. The most vulnerable groups within Jordanian society. including. women. youths. poor households. ethnic minorities and disadvantaged communities (e.g.. vulnerable migrants and refugees) in the project area will also benefit from improved water management and reduced vulnerability to shocks/rising demands. The project will encourage the participation of these vulnerable groups in all consultations planned at national level in order to foster community decision-making and improve their access to communal ecosystem resources. The number of beneficiaries depends on the selection of the site where the operational project will be implemented.,,Provision of sustainable agricultural water resources and their efficient management through the application of the three-pronged approach (water harvesting. conjunctive use of groundwater and solar-powered drip irrigation) in Jordan.,Fully developed and operational area of water harvesting with conjunctive groundwater and solar power for lifting irrigation water;Strengthened national capacities to adopt. operate and maintain the proposed the three-pronged approach (water harvesting. conjunctive use of groundwater. solar-powered irrigation);Established community of practice. empowered and fully responsible for operating the three- pronged approach;Prepared appropriate long-term policy. regulatory and institutional frameworks to facilitate the adoption and scale-up of the three-pronged approach and integrate it within national food- water-energy related policies/strategies and programmes;Produced and widely disseminated to relevant stakeholders in the country outreach materials. including guides. technical reports. etc.,To increase resilience of rural Jordanian and other disadvantaged communities in the context of water scarcity for agriculture. increasing demand for food and livelihood provision from growing populations. and rising energy demand.The project will focus on the northern region where the impacts of the humanitarian crisis on the Water-Food-Energy nexus are the most tangible.,The project contributes to UNDAF's priorities in Jordan. and to FAO's Country Programme Framework (CPF). The project also aligns with FAO's Regional Initiatives in the Near East and North Africa Region. particularly the Water Scarcity Initiative and Small-Scale Agriculture for Inclusive Development. In addition. the project harmonizes with several of Jordan's national strategies and plans. During the inception phase of the project.

These efforts are helping to safeguard the livelihoods of nomadic herder families.,With more than 65% of rangeland affected by degradation and 70 million animals. Mongolia is at a crossroad of its development path. Although classified as middle income country. poverty rates in rural areas are still high (26.4%). After years of economic expansion. the GDP growth dropped to 1% in 2016. Highly dependent on the mineral sector. Mongolias economy is poorly diversified and unable to take advantage from its huge animal wealth due to poor marketing and animal diseases which are poorly addressed. The country is regularly affected by natural disasters which are exacerbated by climate change. More than 80% of its territory is rangeland belonging to the State and representing the major livelihood source for herders. There is an urgent need to curb rangeland degradation by introducing sustainable rangeland management systems in order to maintain this public good and to ensure increased incomes in the rural areas. ,sustainably managed pastures and healthy animals mongolias green gold since the collapse of the soviet union in the number of livestock in mongolia has nearly tripled to the detriment of the countrys grasslands the sdc is supporting an array of measures to encourage the sustainable use of pastureland and to improve animal health and the marketing of livestock products these efforts are helping to safeguard the livelihoods of nomadic herder families with more than of rangeland affected by degradation and million animals mongolia is at a crossroad of its development path although classified as middle income country poverty rates in rural areas are still high after years of economic expansion the gdp growth dropped to in highly dependent on the mineral sector mongolias economy is poorly diversified and unable to take advantage from its huge animal wealth due to poor marketing and animal diseases which are poorly addressed the country is regularly affected by natural disasters which are exacerbated by climate change more than of its territory is rangeland belonging to the state and representing the major livelihood source for herders there is an urgent need to curb rangeland degradation by introducing sustainable rangeland management systems in order to maintain this public good and to ensure increased incomes in the rural areas,Sustainable rangeland management (outcome 1): 80000 herder households (320000 people. 50%F);

The program empowers the territorial stakeholders in the cocoa and fishing value chains and the basic grains production chain located in the mid and lower watershed of the Patuca river. It promotes public-private alliances that respect indigenous rights in accordance to the convention 169 of the international labor organization. These public-private alliances generate 3000 new jobs and increase the income of 1500 indigenous families by 10-30%.,The 96.000 persons who live in the Honduran Muskitia include four excluded indigenous groups as well as mestizos and non-indigenous settlers. The principal socio-economic zone of the Muskitia is the mid and lower watershed of the Patuca river. the second longest river in Honduras. Economic activity in this zone is based on agriculture: cocoa. basic grains and fishing. centered on primary production with little added value and poor productive infrastructure. State presence is weak. the institutions that are present do not have the resources needed to provide adequate services. and application of ILO 169 has not been respected in the past.Nevertheless. the territorial councils - the Muskitia indigenous structures -are developing livelihood plans and the municipalities. municipal development plans. In addition. in 2012 the government began to implement programs for development and prevention of violence in order to recover territory occupied by narco-trafficking; in 2016 it launched the Muskitia Development Alliance together with the indigenous peoples. local government and donor agencies. In 2015. donors organized a Muskitia cooperation roundtable. giving priority to shared governance and basing their work on shared guiding principles. In 2016. with donor support. the government initiated the process of establishing a territorial governance platform to promote free and prior consultation with the indigenous peoples. following ILO 169. The platform was formally established on April 4. 2017 with three thematic roundtables: governance and justice. economic development. and social development. making it possible to address territorial conflicts in a structured way.

With the program. Switzerland promotes income for the indigenous population. improves food security and thus contributes to reducing migration and improving regional stability. In cooperation with the private sector the program generates 1000 net new jobs. seeks to increment the income of 1700 families by 5% per year (USD 360/year in 2020). and promotes an increase in public investment in the territory by at least 10% per year. ,The region of the Honduran Mosquitia. located mainly in the department of Gracias a Dios. is a highly important area in biological terms and due to its ecosystem services. It is also home to 4 indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples: Miskitu. Garífuna. Tawahka and Pech. The Honduran Mosquitia faces significant environmental challenges: floods. tropical cyclones and forest fires top the list of natural threats. while pollution. deforestation and poor fishing practices are among the anthropogenic threats. The population of La Mosquitia faces high levels of multidimensional poverty. which reaches an incidence rate of 71.8% of households. 4.6 percentage points higher than the national average (67.2%) and in some municipalities of the department exceeds 80.0%. In addition. the territory has an open unemployment rate of 13.6% of the population. 18.4% for women and 11% for men. and a food insecurity index of 79.4% (8 out of 10 households in the Mosquitia area are food insecure).Resource governance also triggers conflicts between municipalities and indigenous communities among other things due to the predominance of an extractivist model that does not create any benefits for the local population. the loss of access to land by indigenous families. and the invasion of coastal waters designated for artisanal fishery by commercial fishing vessels. Despite the high levels of vulnerability and conflict. the need for employment. income and food security remains an important factor that brings the different stakeholders together and incentivizes them to manage jointly the development of their territory. However. indigenous businesses face unfair competition from companies financed by drug trafficking. which affects the profitability and sustainability of these business initiatives.In recent years. the government has increased its presence in the Mosquitia. which contributes to the solution of conflicts at different levels of the value chains.

Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA) will clear over 27km² of heavily contaminated land ensuring safe access to productive land and improving poor rural communities livelihoods. SDCs support to Cambodias mine action aligns with the Maputo Declaration 15 commitment to declare Cambodia mine-free by 2025 and with the Swiss Humanitarian Mine Action Strategy (2016  2019).,As a result of past internal and regional conflicts Cambodia is still one of the most mine affected countries in the world. which poses serious adverse socio-economic impacts on rural communities including human loss and disabilities as well as restrictions on access to agricultural land. pasture land. forests. and water resources.

While circa 70% of IDPs are forced into exile by conflicts. more than 60% of them live in the Somali National Regional State (SNRS) alone. The El Niño-induced drought along with the recent floods has increased the vulnerability of the population and led to a significant increase of IDPs.Ethiopian IDPs are forced to move by both man-made and natural disasters. The lack of proper mechanisms to address the root causes of forced displacement often translates into protracted displacement for over a decade. Devising durable solutions is all the more challenging considering the lack of information available (coping mechanisms. access to services and displacement patterns. including secondary movements) as well as the fact that the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) acknowledged the issues of IDPs only recently.

Livestock Sect. in ASAL,KENYA - Strengthening Livestock Sector in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) Counties,60% of the population in northern Kenya depends on livestock production in an environment of recurrent droughts and natural resource-based conflicts. The programme will contribute to poverty reduction. improved resilience to shocks and enhanced socio-economic inclusion of pastoralist and agro-pastoralist men and women by supporting climate-smart livestock production. improving rangelands management and promoting peaceful coexistence of communities.,The ASAL counties account for more than half of Kenyas landmass (61%) with a population of about 5.53 million. Their inhabitants are mainly dependent on pastoral livestock production. The area is characterised by low. variable and unpredictable bimodal rainfall and rangelands are unsustainable for crop production. An estimated 60% of the population lives in extreme poverty conditions. Populations in this region do not effectively benefit from the mainstream national systems including access to competitive markets and formal financial services. These factors. coupled with frequent droughts linked to climate change and violent conflicts. have resulted in high food insecurity and displacement of populations. The long-standing fragility factors have recently been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the invasion of desert locusts since 2020.

Haiti,The SQUAT program aims to improve access to the labor market and increase the income of 10.000 craftsmen. masters and apprentices in the construction sector in the Grand Sud region of Haiti. To achieve this. the program plans to strengthen the training offer for professionals. support professional organizations. network them and create bridges between formal and informal training. With a dual apprenticeship system recognized and appreciated by sector players in Haiti. Switzerland is in a privileged position to support this process.,Since the 1973 decree that created the National Institute of Vocational Training (INFP). the need to ensure the training of a qualified workforce for the inclusive economic development of Haiti has been repeatedly recalled in all documents analyzing the vocational training system. However. the capacity of territorial or national. state or sectoral. public or private institutions to implement a coherent and sustained policy of training and professional integration remains to be built. The ongoing climate of socio-political and economic instability that has prevailed in the country for more than 30 years does not favor the establishment and monitoring of a long-term strategy and consideration of the vocational training sector as a priority sector. Indeed. the Ministry of Education devotes less than 2% of its small budget to it. which barely covers the structural costs of its National Institute of Vocational Training. Consequently. the management of the sector follows a project logic. to the detriment of a coherent and sustainable training engineering system. A system of certification by competence. the basis for validation of acquired experience. only exists in fragments. The coordination of the sector is poorly structured and does not give space to the actors of the labor market. At the departmental level. more inclusive spaces for consultation are being created. In terms of regulation. the Law on the reorganization and modernization of technical and professional training was promulgated on May 21. 2018. It provides for more inclusive management of the sector. through a National Public-Private Council. and the creation of a Center for Research and Professional Development which will deal with the certification and training of trainers.,qualification and access to work system squat haiti the squat program aims to improve access to the labor market and increase the income of craftsmen masters and apprentices in the construction sector in the grand sud region of haiti to achieve this the program plans to strengthen the training offer for professionals support professional organizations network them and create bridges between formal and informal training with a dual apprenticeship system recognized and appreciated by sector players in haiti switzerland is in a privileged position to support this process since the decree that created the national institute of vocational training infp the need to ensure the training of a qualified workforce for the inclusive economic development of haiti has been repeatedly recalled in all documents analyzing the vocational training system however the capacity of territorial or national state or sectoral public or private institutions to implement a coherent and sustained policy of training and professional integration remains to be built the ongoing climate of sociopolitical and economic instability that has prevailed in the country for more than years does not favor the establishment and monitoring of a longterm strategy and consideration of the vocational training sector as a priority sector indeed the ministry of education devotes less than of its small budget to it which barely covers the structural costs of its national institute of vocational training consequently the management of the sector follows a project logic to the detriment of a coherent and sustainable training engineering system a system of certification by competence the basis for validation of acquired experience only exists in fragments the coordination of the sector is poorly structured and does not give space to the actors of the labor market at the departmental level more inclusive spaces for consultation are being created in terms of regulation the law on the reorganization and modernization of technical and professional training was promulgated on may it provides for more inclusive management of the sector through a national publicprivate council and the creation of a center for research and professional development which will deal with the certification and training of trainers,Construction professionals: apprentices on the job. apprentices in training centers. trainers.

The CCR has also worked to improve Training Engineering. strengthen the capacities of socio-professional associations. integrate women into construction. train and certify trainers. network stakeholders. and raise awareness for the adoption of safe construction practices.,Construction sector professionals in the Grand Sud (m/f) increase their income by using the skills required by current and future markets.

Agricultural research investment levels in most low- and middle-income countries still very low. In this context. access to multi-stakeholder networks and their inter-connectivity will become more important in future.

7F09921,1,0,,Provincial & Local Governence Support  I,Provincial and Local Governance Support Program (PLGSP),Nepals new federal constitution addresses the long-standing root causes of conflict related to poverty. gender inequality and social exclusion. The Provincial and Local Governance Support Program is the governments nationwide framework capacity building initiative to enable the newly elected provincial and local governments to assume their constitutional rights and duties. Switzerland led the planning for the development partners. The program will strengthen subnational institutions and service delivery. and contribute to peace and stability. ,Nepals federal constitution (2015) requires to restructure Nepals polity through devolution of power and inclusive institutions. The former unitary system has been converted into three tiers of governance. creating 753 local governments. 7 provincial governments and the federal government. Executive and legislative powers are shared between different tiers. Exclusive and concurrent rights are granted to all tiers of government for the execution of their duties and they are often overlapping. The new governments are expected to work together through a system of cooperation. coordination and coexistence.The implementation of the new federal constitution has been substantial with the completion of elections at all three tiers of government. However. despite impressive progress. the lack of preparation at the subnational levels and the absence of an overarching transition management plan are hampering a smooth implementation of the constitution and are risking a deterioration in service delivery and the resurgence of new conflicts. The establishment of inclusive provincial and local governance institutions and systems is therefore critical. It will require new competencies. structures and resources. Critical dimensions in this regard include devolving the public administration; institutionalization of fiscal federalism including establishment of intergovernmental fiscal transfers; and local service delivery mechanisms. In the meantime. the federal government is also expected to adopt the spirit of federalism and to change itself to support the transition. as transformation from a unitary state to a federal system involves significant structural. behavioral and perception changes.Supporting the federalization process by promoting the implementation of the constitution is key to address long-standing root causes of conflict in Nepal related to poverty and various forms of discrimination as happened in the past. Given the importance of a successful federal experience for the conclusion of Nepals peace process. and given the profound challenges outlined above. the government and like-minded development partners have decided to support the federalization process through a nationwide Provincial and Local Governance Support Program (PLGSP). PLGSP will be the only national framework program to empower subnational governments in line with the constitution. It will be a government-led program that is fully owned and managed by all governments across the three tiers of the new federal structure. ,provincial and local governance support program plgsp nepals new federal constitution addresses the longstanding root causes of conflict related to poverty gender inequality and social exclusion the provincial and local governance support program is the governments nationwide framework capacity building initiative to enable the newly elected provincial and local governments to assume their constitutional rights and duties switzerland led the planning for the development partners the program will strengthen subnational institutions and service delivery and contribute to peace and stability nepals federal constitution requires to restructure nepals polity through devolution of power and inclusive institutions the former unitary system has been converted into three tiers of governance creating local governments provincial governments and the federal government executive and legislative powers are shared between different tiers exclusive and concurrent rights are granted to all tiers of government for the execution of their duties and they are often overlapping the new governments are expected to work together through a system of cooperation coordination and coexistencethe implementation of the new federal constitution has been substantial with the completion of elections at all three tiers of government however despite impressive progress the lack of preparation at the subnational levels and the absence of an overarching transition management plan are hampering a smooth implementation of the constitution and are risking a deterioration in service delivery and the resurgence of new conflicts the establishment of inclusive provincial and local governance institutions and systems is therefore critical it will require new competencies structures and resources critical dimensions in this regard include devolving the public administration institutionalization of fiscal federalism including establishment of intergovernmental fiscal transfers and local service delivery mechanisms in the meantime the federal government is also expected to adopt the spirit of federalism and to change itself to support the transition as transformation from a unitary state to a federal system involves significant structural behavioral and perception changessupporting the federalization process by promoting the implementation of the constitution is key to address longstanding root causes of conflict in nepal related to poverty and various forms of discrimination as happened in the past given the importance of a successful federal experience for the conclusion of nepals peace process and given the profound challenges outlined above the government and likeminded development partners have decided to support the federalization process through a nationwide provincial and local governance support program plgsp plgsp will be the only national framework program to empower subnational governments in line with the constitution it will be a governmentled program that is fully owned and managed by all governments across the three tiers of the new federal structure,All 753 local and 7 provincial governments. and their elected representatives and officials. are the major target groups as well as the main beneficiaries. PLGSP mainly intends to build their capacity and establish their institutions. systems and structures on a demand basis. Elected representatives at subnational levels. both executive and legislative. including from women and disadvantaged groups. will benefit from the program. In addition to the subnational levels. federal government ministries. agencies and institutions are also a primary target group. Local government associations - both national and provincial chapters - and civil society organizations including the private sector are a secondary target group. ,PLGSP is a new program that is modeled after the experience of the successful Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP) which formally ended in 2018. LGCDP managed to improve relations between state and citizens in the absence of locally elected representatives. mainly through social mobilization. The program also led to visible empowerment of disadvantaged groups. evidenced by the fact that around one third of the newly elected local representatives were beneficiaries of LGCDP. Importantly. the experience of LGCDP has shown that a government led and implemented program is critical to ensure national ownership and sustainable results. Accordingly. development partners supported an inclusive. Nepali-led multi-stakeholder planning process which took two years to complete. It also resulted in PLGSP becoming an official government program that is implemented on-budget and on-treasury through a basket fund.,Government institutions at federal. provincial and local level as well as inter-governmental mechanisms are functioning in support of federal governance as per the Constitution.Provincial and local governments have efficient. effective. inclusive and accountable institutions.Elected representatives and civil servants at provincial and local governments serve citizens to their satisfaction.,There are a total of 14 outputs proposed which aim to capture achievements of and cooperation between federal. provincial and local governments. The main expected outputs from this phase are:Federal level institutions develop legislations and policies to support provincial and local governments in a consultative mannerInter-governmental administrative mechanisms strengthenedProvincial governments draft legislation in a consultative mannerProvincial government systems provide horizontal and vertical accountability to all citizens and mainstream Gender Equality and Social Inclusion  Provincial Centers for Good Governance deliver capacity development servicesLocal government systems provide horizontal and vertical accountability to all citizensInnovation Partnership Fund is operational and transparently supporting local governments innovative practicesProvincial governments elected representatives and civil servants are incentivized and trained for delivering high quality servicesLocal governments elected representatives and civil servants are empowered and trained for delivering high quality services ,Provincial and local governments are fully functional. sustainable. inclusive and accountable to their citizens.,PLGSP is the governments national framework program. All future federalism related capacity building initiatives at subnational levels will have to be aligned with and complementary to PLGSP. In the Swiss focus area of Province 1. PLGSP will coordinate with SDCs forthcoming bilateral State Support Program through its Provincial Steering Committee. PLGSP will also take over the outputs and learnings from SDC Interim Capacity for Federalism Support Project. and coordinate its capacity building activities at the local level with the SDC supported She Leads womens empowerment program. In other provinces where Australia. Germany. UK and US are setting up bilateral subnational governance programs. PLGSP will also ensure complementarity through its Provincial Steering Committees. PLGSP also complements the World Bank administered multi-donor trust fund on Public Financial Management supported by SECO in Nepal. ,PLGSP is the government of Nepals capacity building framework program supported by the EU. Norway. Switzerland. UK and the UN system. It is implemented by government through an on-budget and on-treasury basket fund.

The proposed programme supports key stakeholders to improve pro-people policymaking and provides a platform for SDC to showcase lessons learned from over fifty years of development cooperation in Pakistan. Such knowledge transfer and institutionalization is important in the phasing out process of SDCs Pakistan country programme.,Pakistan was among the first countries to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by a unanimous Parliament resolution in 2016. However. since then. the SDG implementation process hasnt advanced much. Policy formulation in Pakistan is still weak. especially due to a lack of data and evidence-based analysis. which are crucial for need-based development agendas addressing the SDGs.

This situation is exacerbated by the pastoral crisis and the deterioration of the security context. particularly in the Sahel and Centre-North regions. The Government has requested the help of partners to assist vulnerable people and Switzerland will contribute through FAO and WFP. ,The 2017/18 agro-pastoral campaign was affected by climatic and phytosanitary phenomena leading to a food and pastoral crisis. Thus. in March 2018. approximately 2.5 million people were &quot;under food pressure&quot;. For the upcoming lean season[1]. the situation will be more worrying with 1 million people in a &quot;food crisis&quot;. including 90.000 people in an emergency situation. The Sahel. Centre-North. East and Centre-West regions are the most affected. In the Sahel. food and nutritional insecurity is aggravated by the security crisis which is leading to internal population displacement and an influx of refugees from Mali. Women and children under 2 years of age are the most affected. Approximately 70.000 children are already suffering from acute malnutrition. The pastoral crisis has increased conflicts over access to the few resources available and the risks of increased diseases and animal mortality. To provide coordinated assistance in food. nutrition. health and protection of livelihoods. the Government and its partners have developed the &quot;2018 Response and Support Plan for Populations Vulnerable to Food Insecurity and Malnutrition&quot;. Several partners (the European Commission&#39;s Directorate for Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO). WFP. FAO. etc.) are supporting the implementation of the 2018 plan.

The outflow of workers from Nepal has peaked in 2015 with half a million people leaving for foreign employment per year. The demand in the Gulf states. Nepals main destination countries. has since decreased due to the slowdown in their economies.Many workers face severe exploitation and other difficulties while abroad. However. migrants often do not receive effective legal and other consular services; as a result. workers collectively lose millions of dollars in redress payments. International policy dialogues are important for Nepal. It presently leads not only the Colombo Process. a regional consultative process of 12 Asian labour sending countries. but also the Technical Working Group on migration of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.

The Global Alliance on Health and Pollution (GAHP). assists these countries to address pollution-related issues by generating scientific evidence for raising awareness and tracking progress and by providing concrete technical and financial support.  ,Pollution is the largest environmental cause of communicable and non-communicable diseases and premature death in the world today. It is responsible for more than 9 million premature deaths a year. The vast majority of its impact (92%) falls on low- and middle-income countries. The poor and the vulnerable are disproportionately affected and children are particularly at risk. Toxic pollution poses serious long-term health and environmental problems. and significantly impedes economic and social development. Cleaner technologies and better enforcement of environmental regulations are needed along with low-cost clean-up. Pollution costs countries around 2% of annual Gross Domestic Product and roughly 7% of health care costs1.

In winter months. the levels of PM2.5 pollution can reach 1.985 micrograms per cubic meter  nearly 80 times the level WHO recommends as safe. The vast majority of that pollution is caused by the burning of coal for homes heating. Air pollution has a devastating impact on childrens health. According to UNICEF and the Public Health Institute. pneumonia is now the second leading cause of under-five child mortality in Mongolia. Children living in a highly-polluted district of Ulaanbaatar were found to have 40% lower lung function than children living in a rural area. In the last 10 years. the incidence of respiratory diseases in the country has increased alarmingly. including a 2.7-fold increase in flu. flu-like symptoms and asthma. In Ulaanbaatar. a 3.5-fold increase in foetal deaths has been documented between winter and summer. These harmful effects are likely to manifest throughout childrens lives and in turn fuelling intergenerational cycles of disadvantage.

Switzerland will contribute through IOM to address the long-term needs of the displaced and host communities in their search for self-sufficiency.  ,The internal displacement situation in Ethiopia is complex. severe. protracted with new level of scale. Natural and man-made disasters are the major drivers of displacement for large numbers of people resulting in loss of human lives and assets. disruption of livelihoods and damaging basic services and infrastructure. as well as weakening coping mechanisms of host communities. The displaced population need not only lifesaving assistance and basic service delivery. but also livelihoods promotion interventions and durable solutions activities.

7F10232,1,0,,BF88 - CO_Main credit,Project to promote responsible gold panning,The artisanal mining sector employs more than 800.000 people in Burkina Faso. Exploitation is largely informal. poorly supervised by the State and generates serious environmental. social and economic problems. Switzerland promotes responsible gold mining by strengthening the national system of supervision of the sector and by supporting local stakeholders at six sites to improve services and working conditions and reduce negative impacts.,Burkina Faso has been experiencing a mining boom since the 2000s. In 2020. gold accounted for 84% of export revenues. far ahead of cotton. This boom is not only due to industrial gold mining. but also to artisanal mining. which has expanded significantly and employs around 800.000 people. It is estimated that artisanal mining is a source of income for 20% of the country&#39;s population. However. the vast majority of artisanal mines operate informally. with little supervision by the State. Artisanal mining sites are thus marked by enormous environmental. health. social and economic problems. The local authorities. which are the first to be impacted by mining activity. especially in the event of conflict. do not have any competence transferred by the State to support or intervene in this sub-sector. In 2015. Burkina Faso created the National Agency for the Supervision of Artisanal and Semi-Mechanized Mining (ANEEMAS). which aims to supervise artisanal mining activity and promote responsible gold mining. With the security crisis in the country. supervision of the artisanal mining sector has become even more important. The informality of the sector facilitates illicit financial flows and artisanal mines are suspected of contributing to the financing of armed groups. This project therefore faces significant risks. which requires a strong focus on conflict-sensitive management.,project to promote responsible gold panning the artisanal mining sector employs more than people in burkina faso exploitation is largely informal poorly supervised by the state and generates serious environmental social and economic problems switzerland promotes responsible gold mining by strengthening the national system of supervision of the sector and by supporting local stakeholders at six sites to improve services and working conditions and reduce negative impacts burkina faso has been experiencing a mining boom since the s in gold accounted for of export revenues far ahead of cotton this boom is not only due to industrial gold mining but also to artisanal mining which has expanded significantly and employs around people it is estimated that artisanal mining is a source of income for of the countrys population however the vast majority of artisanal mines operate informally with little supervision by the state artisanal mining sites are thus marked by enormous environmental health social and economic problems the local authorities which are the first to be impacted by mining activity especially in the event of conflict do not have any competence transferred by the state to support or intervene in this subsector in burkina faso created the national agency for the supervision of artisanal and semimechanized mining aneemas which aims to supervise artisanal mining activity and promote responsible gold mining with the security crisis in the country supervision of the artisanal mining sector has become even more important the informality of the sector facilitates illicit financial flows and artisanal mines are suspected of contributing to the financing of armed groups this project therefore faces significant risks which requires a strong focus on conflictsensitive management,Direct: 6.100 beneficiary artisanal miners and 500 women working on artisanal mining sites; The target partner groups are local authorities. decentralized technical services of the State. umbrella organizations of artisanal miners; Civil society organizations. local radio stations. private operators supplying goods and services. NGOs operating in the artisanal mining sector and industrial mining companies. Indirect: The total population of the intervention zone estimated at 312.000 inhabitants. as well as the populations of other mining sites in Burkina Faso. through support for ANEEMAS. which covers the entire national territory.,The SDC&#39;s &quot;Clean Gold&quot; regional pilot project and the interventions of other TFPs in the artisanal mining sector have made it possible to achieve the following results: Extraction techniques without the use of chemicals have been popularized with convincing results; The rights of women and children in artisanal gold production sites have been promoted. In terms of lessons learned. we can note: The legal framework must be improved so that it is more favorable to artisanal mining; The involvement of local authorities in supporting artisanal miners is important to enable the creation of a framework for dialogue between them and local management; Good communication and awareness-raising among stakeholders helps improve the confidence of artisanal miners and increase the sustainability of interventions; Processing systems without toxic chemicals must achieve significantly higher gold yields than traditional processes in order to attract the lasting interest of artisanal miners.,Effect 1: ANEEMAS supervises the artisanal gold sector and strengthens the capacities of local stakeholders; Effect 2: Local authorities participate in the management of artisanal mining according to their communal charters and improve trust between the different stakeholders in the sector; Effect 3: Actors in the artisanal gold mining production chain adopt practices that are more respectful of the environment. human rights (including the rights of women and children) and occupational health and safety., ANEEMAS. in close collaboration with the project manager and stakeholders. contributes to the improvement and adoption of regulatory texts favorable to artisanal mining activity. ANEEMAS has the technical capacities necessary to support artisanal miners. Trust between artisanal miners and the role played by local authorities is improving. Local authorities are implementing mechanisms to increase investments for the benefit (directly or indirectly) of artisanal mining activity and mobilize more resources. Stakeholders in the artisanal mining sector adhere to the models of the treatment system alternative to toxic chemicals promoted. Measures to promote the human rights (including socio-economic rights) of children and women are applied.,Responsible gold mining is established in artisanal mining sites in Burkina Faso and actors in the artisanal gold production chain benefit from better services and working conditions. contribute to local development and reduce the negative impacts of the sector.,Complementarities with Swiss programs: Support for Decentralization and Citizen Participation (DEPAC).

Swisscontact was selected by call for tenders for the preparatory phase and phase 1. The ProDoc is the main result of this phase. It was based on the various diagnoses conducted. regional workshops (Dosso and Maradi) and a national workshop. The context analysis study carried out by the backstopper and the regional workshops with the stakeholders made it possible to select market gardening. milk. moringa and peanuts as profitable sectors with the capacity to integrate women and young people. The lessons learned from the preparatory phase are: The lack of access of women and young people to land and financing prevents them from being active and developing know-how in the chosen sectors. Potential for optimization in agri-food processing. which is very rudimentary at the moment Existence of business incubation centers that will facilitate support in entrepreneurial paths for PROMEL targets Existence of a public desire to develop certain reforms in favor of local entrepreneurship Tax regime not very favorable to the formalization of businesses , 4.500 women and young people are supported in production and access to markets 500 women and young people are supported in agri-food processing 100 MSMEs have become more competitive 1 digital platform is set up 100 million CFA francs in credit are granted by financial institutions 200 million CFA francs in pre-financing are granted between actors in the value chains 100 self-managed savings and credit groups are promoted 4 multi-actor platforms are supported and influence sectoral regulations, 5.000 women and young people from the Dosso and Maradi regions benefit from employment and income opportunities through agricultural entrepreneurship.

The SDC supports. on the one hand. the World Food Programme (WFP) to provide food to the populations and. on the other hand. the Billital Maroobe Breeders Network (RBM) to provide assistance to pastoral populations and strengthen their resilience.,To prevent too strong a progression of COVID19. West African states have taken measures including the quarantine of entire localities and the closure of markets and borders. These measures have serious consequences on the food and nutritional security of populations because they come on top of persistent structural problems (weak production systems. climate shocks and degradation of natural resources. population growth) and cyclical problems (conflicts. insecurity. armyworm. etc.) that have weakened the region&#39;s capacity to adequately feed populations. These measures will also have a strong impact on the 2020/2021 agro-sylvo-pastoral and fisheries production campaign. Vulnerable populations are currently facing a problem of access to food for themselves and their animals. Switzerland. through its humanitarian aid. has been working with the WFP for many years. especially in Mali. Niger and Chad. and is applying the development-humanitarian nexus (articulation) approach in Mali. Chad and Niger. The project will bring added value to Swiss cooperation programmes in Benin.

Focused on the latter. this contribution provides food insecure urban people a comprehensive support including skills. finance and market linkages aimed at more gainful agriculture. It also supports the coordination and strengthening of related stakeholders. including policy makers.  ,Urban food insecurity and poverty have seen a sharp increase across Zimbabwe. The majority of the urban poor in Zimbabwe make a living in the informal economy. a precarious form of work. This income is often complemented by proceeds  in the form of food or money  from urban agriculture. While agriculture has been present within urban spaces for decades. it has been viewed as a rather trivial activity in terms of its contribution to employment and income and the urban economy overall. Due to the decades long nationwide decrease in agricultural production. imported essential have become unaffordable to the average low-income urban household. Since 2018. the World Food Programme has implemented the Urban Food Security and Resilience Building Programme with the goal of improving urban food security in the face of shocks and stresses with improved coping strategies. Local government authorities play a key role in identification of hotspots in urban areas and are engaged throughout the beneficiary targeting and verification process. Local authorities are also key actors in creating an enabling environment for promoting urban agriculture. providing communal spaces for infrastructure investments. capacity building of local officials. and integrating with other government-led social assistance programmes. Switzerland will draw on its extensive experience of supporting resilience building in rural areas and leverage its position as an experienced actor in the resilience and nexus programming space in the country to increase government and development partner support for investments in urban areas and within broader city region food systems.,urban food security and resilience building programme drawing on learnings by switzerland in rural areas in zimbabwe this program addresses food insecurity in secondary cities through a contribution to a world food programme initiative that combines humanitarian and resilience building solutions focused on the latter this contribution provides food insecure urban people a comprehensive support including skills finance and market linkages aimed at more gainful agriculture it also supports the coordination and strengthening of related stakeholders including policy makers urban food insecurity and poverty have seen a sharp increase across zimbabwe the majority of the urban poor in zimbabwe make a living in the informal economy a precarious form of work this income is often complemented by proceeds in the form of food or money from urban agriculture while agriculture has been present within urban spaces for decades it has been viewed as a rather trivial activity in terms of its contribution to employment and income and the urban economy overall due to the decades long nationwide decrease in agricultural production imported essential have become unaffordable to the average lowincome urban household since the world food programme has implemented the urban food security and resilience building programme with the goal of improving urban food security in the face of shocks and stresses with improved coping strategies local government authorities play a key role in identification of hotspots in urban areas and are engaged throughout the beneficiary targeting and verification process local authorities are also key actors in creating an enabling environment for promoting urban agriculture providing communal spaces for infrastructure investments capacity building of local officials and integrating with other governmentled social assistance programmes switzerland will draw on its extensive experience of supporting resilience building in rural areas and leverage its position as an experienced actor in the resilience and nexus programming space in the country to increase government and development partner support for investments in urban areas and within broader city region food systems,The Swiss contribution will directly impact 10.000 and indirectly impact 40.000 foodinsecure people in three urban areas/secondary cities (Bulawayo.

These statistics together put up a picture that. domestic tourism is indeed in rapid rise in Nepal.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on Nepal´s tourism sector. Although it is expected to slowly recover once international tourism resumes in 2022. the rate of recovery of domestic tourists is expected to be much faster. Investment in domestic and regional tourism could prove to be a lifesaver for the industry and hence poverty reduction.Realising dreams of prosperity and not falling back into conflict again in Nepal can only be guaranteed by successful implementation of the Constitution which largely rely on the degree of cooperation. coordination and coexistence among all spheres of government.

It will work with the Nepali Government to provide reintegration services and support policy development to anchor them in the federal structure. Switzerland has a key interest that the potential of migration for development is fully used and is well positioned to engage on the topic. given its track record in migration in Nepal. ,While labour migration is a central factor of Nepals social and economic development. many migrant workers and their families face significant social costs. As a result. the Government of Nepal has repeatedly called upon migrant workers to return and find employment in country. There is however no systematic support for returnee migrant workers to reintegrate more easily and allow the country to fully benefit from economic and social remittances that migrants acquire during their foreign employment. There is no policy framework on reintegration. clarifying the roles and responsibilities of different spheres of government. nor data on returnee migrant workers. The governments efforts to create jobs for unemployed people are insufficient and local governments. which are in the lead to support the reintegration process. do not have the capacities and resources to initiate any comprehensive reintegration programmes.

Phase I,Udaya  Investment and Innovation for Economic Development,This programme aims for women and men to benefit from socioeconomic progress through growth and innovation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Province 1 of Nepal. Working with the provincial government. it will enhance the framework conditions for SMEs by enabling access to pertinent business development services. growth capital. and information on relevant public initiatives and services. It leverages Switzerlands expertise in private sector development. blended finance. and federalisation.,SMEs play a crucial role in Nepals economy. employing 1.7 million people. contributing around 22% to the national GDP. and bringing services closer to the people. However. SMEs in Nepal have only witnessed modest growth year-on-year. Firstly. SMEs suffer from a low capital base. poor access to technology. and inadequate knowledge regarding business opportunities and marketing. Secondly. they face limited access to new financing. This does not only result in a low value addition in the overall economy. but also curtails SMEs potential in mobilising innovation and new products. creating jobs. rendering the economy more flexible. and paying taxes to authorities.With the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal 2015. Nepal has transitioned to a federal state. Governments at all the three spheres (i.e.. federal. provincial. and local) have recognised the pivotal role of SMEs in contributing to the achievement of locally. provincially. and nationally set development goals. Federalism has created new opportunities. particularly at the provincial level. to bridge SMEs knowledge and financing gaps. Province 1 is the strategic focus area of the Swiss Cooperation Programme in Nepal. It is therefore a promising entry point for supporting the growth of SMEs. since the SDC can build upon a continued engagement with the Province 1 leadership in pushing for reforms at the provincial level.,udaya investment and innovation for economic development this programme aims for women and men to benefit from socioeconomic progress through growth and innovation of small and medium enterprises smes in province of nepal working with the provincial government it will enhance the framework conditions for smes by enabling access to pertinent business development services growth capital and information on relevant public initiatives and services it leverages switzerlands expertise in private sector development blended finance and federalisation smes play a crucial role in nepals economy employing million people contributing around to the national gdp and bringing services closer to the people however smes in nepal have only witnessed modest growth yearonyear firstly smes suffer from a low capital base poor access to technology and inadequate knowledge regarding business opportunities and marketing secondly they face limited access to new financing this does not only result in a low value addition in the overall economy but also curtails smes potential in mobilising innovation and new products creating jobs rendering the economy more flexible and paying taxes to authoritieswith the promulgation of the constitution of nepal nepal has transitioned to a federal state governments at all the three spheres ie federal provincial and local have recognised the pivotal role of smes in contributing to the achievement of locally provincially and nationally set development goals federalism has created new opportunities particularly at the provincial level to bridge smes knowledge and financing gaps province is the strategic focus area of the swiss cooperation programme in nepal it is therefore a promising entry point for supporting the growth of smes since the sdc can build upon a continued engagement with the province leadership in pushing for reforms at the provincial level,Direct target group: Established SMEs that have high growth and innovation potential. but are underfunded  including SMEs owned and managed by women and members of discriminated groups.Indirect target group: Women and men in Province 1 who rely on private sector development to move out of poverty and improve well-being as owners. employees as well as clients of SMEs.,Constraints to SMEs growth in Nepal lie at two levels. On the one hand. the current regulatory framework limits their productive potential. On the other hand. constraints exist at the enterprise level. such as limited access to business development services and growth capital. The MSMEs financing gap in Nepal is estimated at USD 3.6 billion. Since Q3-2020. the SDC has supported the COVID-19 Micro Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Fund Nepal. which helped 100 MSMEs retain more than 1.000 jobs. and create more than 350 additional new jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results indicate that bringing easier access to finance and business development services together can help enterprises move to a higher growth equilibrium and build foundations for sustained future growth. While the COVID-19 MSME Fund Nepal is slightly different in nature. these findings have been important to the Udaya design process.,Outcome 1: SMEs grow and are able to innovate as they have access to business development services. capital. and information on public initiatives and incentives.Outcome 2: Banking and financial institutions increase the lending to SMEs. including to SMEs that use business development services.Outcome 3: Government of Province 1 enhances the framework conditions for the growth of SMEs.,Output 1.1: SMEs have access to quality business development services.Output 1.2: SMEs have access to information on public initiatives and incentives relevant to them.Output 2.1: Partnering banking and financial institutions have a pipeline of investment-ready SMEs.Output 2.2: Providers of pre-loan business development services earn success-linked payments as an incentive.Output 3.1: The Government of Province 1 implements a Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) that is geared towards supporting private actors in improving their services for SMEs.Output 3.2: The Government of Province 1 leverages a blended finance mechanism to improve SMEs access to capital.Output 3.3: The Government of Province 1 receives assistance for the creation of a digital information portal to address information gaps faced by SMEs to access public services and benefits.,Women and men benefit from socioeconomic progress in Province 1. through growth and innovation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs).,Nepal Agriculture Markets Development Programme (NAMDP).

Rural poor are particularly subject to potential negative impacts of those development projects such as loss of access to land. In recent years. the Government of Lao PDR has questioned the effectiveness of the policy formulated in 2010 and adopted land tenure security improvement as a strategy for improving a transparent and accountable system of governance in rural areas that also protects the countrys natural capital and provides greater socio-economic opportunities for the countrys citizens.

Therefore the support of the poorest farmers in the most remote areas by improving and securing their livelihoods is crucial in order to strenghten sustainable natural resources management and the communities resilience. It is interwoven with the humanitarian appeal of Aga Khan Foundation supported by Switzerland. ,With the takeover of the Taliban on August 2021. the country faces an uncertain transitional period. Already prior to this date the population was suffering from a triple crisis of conflict. Covid-19 and drought. By October 2021 nearly 19 million of people (47% of the population) were highly food insecure and dependent on humanitarian aid.Afghanistan is carachterised by weak community-based institutions. high frequency of natural disasters (mainly due to the negative impact of climate change). high population growth. protracted crisis and internal displacement. All these factors are the main drivers of food insecurity.In remote mountainous districts. the situation is further critical due to short growing season. poor  linkage between farmers and markets. small landholdings. lack of proper water management system. poor quality and limited access to crop inputs. lack of access to finance. and excessive use of natural resources.The lack of economic opportunities in remote districts. along with the loss of jobs due to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have further adversely affected the households income level. Besides. food prices continue to increase due to the economic and financial crisis.

7F10737,1,0,,Quality TVET for Youth (QualiTY),,The overall goal of the project is for Nepalese youth to benefit from quality Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and better employment prospects. To achieve this. the project will support the federal. provincial and local governments of Nepal to establish an accreditation and coaching system so that TVET schools can improve and meet national quality requirements. The project capitalises on Switzerlands long-standing and unique expertise in TVET federalisation.,In Nepal. TVET is a vector of social and economic development. The importance of young people having adequate competencies to find employment in formal sectors has become even more visible with the COVID-19 pandemic. which has pushed many informal workers. especially women. back to poverty due to the absence of safety nets. While TVET is relevant to ensure that youth can integrate the formal labour market with the right competencies. the progress in improving the quality of TVET programmes remains limited in Nepal. This is mainly due to the fact that there is no national accreditation system for TVET schools (accreditation is the third-party evaluation of schools against recognised standards). The absence of an accreditation system results in inconsistent and poor quality education. high number of student drop-outs and low trust from employers in the TVET system. The federalisation of the TVET sector provides an opportunity for the Government of Nepal to establish a national accreditation system. whereby the federal government can execute its constitutional mandate in standards setting and quality assurance. and provincial and local governments in their implementation. Provincial governments are indeed mandated by the constitution to manage TVET programmes at secondary level and above. while local governments manage TVET courses up to secondary level. Quality TVET for Youth will thus provide expertise to all tiers of government to establish this system. including to provincial governments to form a dedicated Office for TVET that will be responsible to implement accreditation in each Province and establish a coaching mechanism to mentor TVET schools Principals.,the overall goal of the project is for nepalese youth to benefit from quality technical and vocational education and training tvet and better employment prospects to achieve this the project will support the federal provincial and local governments of nepal to establish an accreditation and coaching system so that tvet schools can improve and meet national quality requirements the project capitalises on switzerlands longstanding and unique expertise in tvet federalisation in nepal tvet is a vector of social and economic development the importance of young people having adequate competencies to find employment in formal sectors has become even more visible with the covid pandemic which has pushed many informal workers especially women back to poverty due to the absence of safety nets while tvet is relevant to ensure that youth can integrate the formal labour market with the right competencies the progress in improving the quality of tvet programmes remains limited in nepal this is mainly due to the fact that there is no national accreditation system for tvet schools accreditation is the thirdparty evaluation of schools against recognised standards the absence of an accreditation system results in inconsistent and poor quality education high number of student dropouts and low trust from employers in the tvet system the federalisation of the tvet sector provides an opportunity for the government of nepal to establish a national accreditation system whereby the federal government can execute its constitutional mandate in standards setting and quality assurance and provincial and local governments in their implementation provincial governments are indeed mandated by the constitution to manage tvet programmes at secondary level and above while local governments manage tvet courses up to secondary level quality tvet for youth will thus provide expertise to all tiers of government to establish this system including to provincial governments to form a dedicated office for tvet that will be responsible to implement accreditation in each province and establish a coaching mechanism to mentor tvet schools principals,Primary target group:   Nepalese youth who will ultimately have better employment prospects if they attend and graduate from programmes in quality TVET schools.

Besides funding. Switzerland makes use of its longstanding experience in decentralised governance and service delivery.,Cambodia started building up its governing structures almost from scratch only in 2000. A first decentralisation reform established democratically elected commune councils with the first local elections in 2002. In 2010. the government adopted the first National Programme for Sub-National Democratic Development 2010-2020 to pursue the reform of sub-national administrations at district and provincial level. At present. the decen­tralisation reform is still impeded by inconsis­tencies in different reforms combined with low capacity and lack of resources for sub-national administrations to effectively implement their duties. Sectoral ministries are still reluctant to transfer meaningful functions. while financial resources have been transferred with complicated procedures. The next steps of reform will now focus on strengthening these new sub-national structures with more capacity building and resources. implemented through the 2nd National Programme for Sub-National Democratic Development 2021-2030. Special attention will be paid to strengthening the coordination of all key reforms at the national level and simplifying relevant procedures for sub-national administrations.Gender equality remains insufficiently addressed in Cambodia due to a general lack of political attention. Women representation is around 20% in local decision-making bodies and in sub-national administrations.

This programme aims at engaging communities to curb the further spread of COVID-19 and enhancing socioeconomic resilience. Drawing upon Switzerlands long-standing experience in providing rapid response and working on inclusive and sustainable development. it focuses on the disadvantaged segments of the population. ,The latest COVID-19 wave has started to spread across Bangladesh in March 2021 at an alarming rate. soon overtaking the number of cases during the first wave. A third wave is expected to follow. based on the more contagious Indian variant that is currently sweeping across Bangladeshs neighbouring countries. Along with major health challenges. the country faces serious and protracted socioeconomic stresses as it tries to meet the basic needs of its huge population. It is estimated that. since the onset of the pandemic. roughly 25 million Bangladeshi have fallen back into poverty. While the renewed country-wide lockdown is negatively affecting the entire population. it is particularly impacting vulnerable communities. At the same time. prevailing vulnerabilities caused by the yearly monsoon and cyclone season are approaching. thereby exacerbating the pressure on the countrys socioeconomic resilience. Limited awareness and misleading information concerning the pandemic. slow roll-out of the vaccination campaign. inadequate hygiene and sanitation facilities. increasing unemployment that leads to loss of income and livelihoods. and inadequate access to social safety net schemes. are some of the key challenges that need to be addressed immediately. While this is a rapid response modality that allows to react in a timely and effective manner to the pressing crisis via six interventions. it also aims to build back better by strengthening the overall resilience of the Bangladeshi society. in line with Switzerlands present and future development portfolio as well as with Bangladeshs national priorities. ,covid prevention and resilience the second wave of the covid virus has affected bangladesh more intensely than the initial phase impeding socioeconomic recovery and reiterating the importance of resilience building this programme aims at engaging communities to curb the further spread of covid and enhancing socioeconomic resilience drawing upon switzerlands longstanding experience in providing rapid response and working on inclusive and sustainable development it focuses on the disadvantaged segments of the population the latest covid wave has started to spread across bangladesh in march at an alarming rate soon overtaking the number of cases during the first wave a third wave is expected to follow based on the more contagious indian variant that is currently sweeping across bangladeshs neighbouring countries along with major health challenges the country faces serious and protracted socioeconomic stresses as it tries to meet the basic needs of its huge population it is estimated that since the onset of the pandemic roughly million bangladeshi have fallen back into poverty while the renewed countrywide lockdown is negatively affecting the entire population it is particularly impacting vulnerable communities at the same time prevailing vulnerabilities caused by the yearly monsoon and cyclone season are approaching thereby exacerbating the pressure on the countrys socioeconomic resilience limited awareness and misleading information concerning the pandemic slow rollout of the vaccination campaign inadequate hygiene and sanitation facilities increasing unemployment that leads to loss of income and livelihoods and inadequate access to social safety net schemes are some of the key challenges that need to be addressed immediately while this is a rapid response modality that allows to react in a timely and effective manner to the pressing crisis via six interventions it also aims to build back better by strengthening the overall resilience of the bangladeshi society in line with switzerlands present and future development portfolio as well as with bangladeshs national priorities,Beneficiaries are disadvantaged communities and people with low socio-economic status nationwide. in particular ethnic and gender minorities. differently abled persons. people who are at high health risk. informal labour. small business owners. internally displaced persons. as well as sex workers and their children.

Hygiene and Sanitation in Niger,Progress in the water and sanitation sector is hampered by strong population growth. Underfunding of the sector does not allow for significant improvements in access to water and sanitation. By contributing to the National Water Fund. Switzerland supports the government in its efforts; through its political dialogue. it supports the decentralization of the sector. where it has strong added value. ,Almost half of the country&#39;s population does not have access to drinking water. and more than 90% do not have access to basic sanitation services. Despite committed sectoral authorities and significant absolute progress made in the last decade. Niger is not making sufficient progress towards the objectives of its national sectoral policy (PROSEHA). which is in line with the ambitions of the sustainable development goals. The reasons are linked to the very high population growth. the capacity limits of private companies. and the underfunding of the sector (31% of the budget). Existing resources are channeled through a national water fund. the common fund mechanism. The hydraulic sector is one of the four areas whose skills must be transferred to local authorities. Switzerland has recognized experience in the field of hydraulics (PHRASEA) and decentralization. where it is the lead partner of the TFPs. It is therefore well placed to support the decentralization of the hydraulic sector.

While the legal framework is fully harmonized with the applicable EU regulations. implementation is lagging behind. The principal responsibility for the provision of communal waste management services (i.e. collection and disposal) lies with the municipalities and their public utilities. Service levels are however poor due to outdated or lack of equipment and infrastructure. poor management practices and deficient law enforcement which leads to widespread pollution of the environment and posing threats to public health. Though environmental awareness amongst citizens is increasing. littering and illegal disposal of waste is ubiquitous. In order to alleviate the burden on municipalities and taxpayers for managing end-of life products. reduce the amount of waste destined for final disposal. and increase rates of recycling. RNM adopted the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy approach. Packaging (glass. PET. cardboard. etc.) constitutes approx. 25% of the communal waste. Currently only 30% of the generated packaging waste in RNM is being collected and recycled or recovered. Valuable resources end up in landfills or pollute the environment. Pakomak is the first EPR system established in RNM and supports the collection and recycling of packaging waste in 37 (out of 84) municipalities covering approx. 70% of the population.

The Latin American context. with approximately 81% of the population living in cities. creates many new challenges and implications for development actors. Central America. with a population of approximately 59% of the population living in cities. is the second-fastest urbanizing region in the world. At current rates of urbanization. the regions urban population will double in size by 2050. welcoming over 25 million new urban dwellers. For the large part. current policies in the region have fallen short of substantially addressing unsustainable urban trends. The consequences of uncontrolled urban growth are an increasing numbers of urban residents living in slums. changes in family and gender patterns. along with increasing challenges relating to exclusion. inequality and social cohesion. all of it exacerbating the existing high levels of insecurity in the region. Empowering cities as local actors of development and governance is thus in line with the Swiss interest to promote peace. governance and the rule of law. Moving forward. cities in Latin America and especially in Central America need to prepare and adapt to provide more and better services. improve infrastructure. expand access to affordable housing. and enable the private sector to create jobs for all and invest in inclusive urban growth.
