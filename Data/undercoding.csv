7F06296,2,1,Other-environment-projects,Rights Link Phase 2,The Rights-Link Project,In 2013. the national economy of Lao PDR grew with 8.1 percent. in large part thanks to foreign direct investments in natural resources-based sectors such as mining. hydropower. and commercial agriculture. However. the surge of investments in natural resources has resulted in increased competition and conflicts over land and is adversely affecting the livelihoods of the rural population. In 2008. SDC launched the Rights-LINK project to improve the management of land and natural resources in Lao PDR.  ,The majority of the Lao population relies on access to land and other natural resources for food and income. but commercial land concessions occupy more and more land: In 2012. an estimated five million hectares. 21 percent of the total land area. had been granted in concessions.While the countrys current economic growth results in new opportunities for employment. growing markets for agricultural products. and improved infrastructure and services. the rural population risks losing access to land and being deprived of their traditional livelihoods. Lao  citizens have few options for participating in or seeking redress on land use decisions.The Rights-LINK project assumes that the core of the problem is lack of knowledge: both rights-holders (local communities) and duty-bearers (government and private sector) lack knowledge about land use rights. roles. and responsibilities. Rural people are often not familiar with the laws and regulations that would enable them to effectively negotiate land deals with government and investors. At the same time. ministries and sectors seldom coordinate when making decisions about allocation and use of land. preventing the Lao government from effectively managing land.SDC launched the Rights-LINK project in 2008.The project has demonstrated that it is possible to address the issue of land rights by educating rightsholders and duty-bearers. SDC launched a new project phase in 2012 and expects to expand the project target area to include not only Saravan. but also Xieng Khuang and Khammouane provinces.,the rightslink project in the national economy of lao pdr grew with percent in large part thanks to foreign direct investments in natural resourcesbased sectors such as mining hydropower and commercial agriculture however the surge of investments in natural resources has resulted in increased competition and conflicts over land and is adversely affecting the livelihoods of the rural population in sdc launched the rightslink project to improve the management of land and natural resources in lao pdr the majority of the lao population relies on access to land and other natural resources for food and income but commercial land concessions occupy more and more land in an estimated five million hectares percent of the total land area had been granted in concessionswhile the countrys current economic growth results in new opportunities for employment growing markets for agricultural products and improved infrastructure and services the rural population risks losing access to land and being deprived of their traditional livelihoods lao citizens have few options for participating in or seeking redress on land use decisionsthe rightslink project assumes that the core of the problem is lack of knowledge both rightsholders local communities and dutybearers government and private sector lack knowledge about land use rights roles and responsibilities rural people are often not familiar with the laws and regulations that would enable them to effectively negotiate land deals with government and investors at the same time ministries and sectors seldom coordinate when making decisions about allocation and use of land preventing the lao government from effectively managing landsdc launched the rightslink project in the project has demonstrated that it is possible to address the issue of land rights by educating rightsholders and dutybearers sdc launched a new project phase in and expects to expand the project target area to include not only saravan but also xieng khuang and khammouane provinces,Land users in the project area whose livelihoods are most threatened by impoverished biodiversity. Key actors in land governance in Lao PDR,Between 2008 and 2012. the Rights-LINK project gave stakeholders at both national and local levels better access to relevant information and knowledge about issues related to land and natural resources use. including legislation. rights. and conflict resolution mechanisms. As a result. communities in Saravan province became more aware of their rights. and duty-bearers were better equipped to manage land issues and conflicts.,,SDC expects that the Rights-LINK project. during its second phase. will continue to improve both rightsholders and duty-bearers capacity for informed and equitable land management in Lao PDR.Specifically. the project is expected to:Educate and influence policy makers in the National Assembly of the Lao PDR and relevant ministries. so that they take into account equitable land use and related gender issues when making decisions.Establish dialogue spaces. where local communities voices can be heard and dialogue on land issues can take place.Educate at least 36.000 people on land rights and conflict resolution and improve the outcome of at least 20 land-related decisions. through developing and applying improved conflict resolution or prevention mechanisms.Ensure that at least 16.000 people. who experience land-related conflicts or threats. receive the appropriate support from civil society. government authorities. or both.,The Rights-LINK project seeks to educate actors from government. civil society. the private sector. and local communities. particularly women and ethnic groups. and improve their capacity. knowledge. and access to decision making on land-related issues.Ultimately. the Rights-LINK project aims for local communities to be able to exercise their full land rights. including secure land tenure and the right to use their land in a sustainable and equitable manner.,,,,,2012,31.12.2016 00:00,2455000,2253628.56,,,,[agency:sdc],[aidtype:projectprogrammecontribution],[partnercontract:otherngointforeignnorth],Village Focus International; National Land Management Authority.

Bureaucratic regulatory obstacles have been placed in the way of their registration (23% are without an up-to-date registration). and some areas of work in which civil society. sectoral and thematic organisations used to engage have in practice been vetoed. leading them to implicitly self-censor their activities.The civic space in Bolivia has been reduced as a result of the introduction of restrictions on financing. combined with propaganda that harms the image of the civil society sector. Since 2011 NGO activity has shrunk by 1/3. with only 4% of all NGOs now working on environmental issues. for example. This contrasts with the political discourse of the government. whose political base is social movements with a presence in government. pursuing corporate interests and engaging in rent-seeking behaviour.Over the last decade. the state has taken over some development issues previously worked on by civil society.

7F07563,2,1,Solar-energy,Healthy Generation (YFHS),Youth Friendly Health Services in Moldova,In Moldova. young people face various health challenges which are currently not adequately addressed by health services. To improve this situation. Youth Friendly Health Services started as pilots in 2005 and are being scaled-up by the Ministry of Health since 2011. with the support of SDC. The project is focused on improving the quality and enhancing the comprehensiveness of the services. as well as on the community support for young people to adopt a healthier lifestyle and seek assistance from health services.  ,Young people make up nearly a quarter of the total population in Moldova. They face various health issues. such as sexual and reproductive problems. substance abuse. mental health disorders and suicide. The Moldovan health system did not yet completely overcome the legacy of the Soviet times. which focused solely on disease control. while disregarding the needs of specific target groups. In 2010. a radical public health reform has been launched. However. so far. it remains partial. with a need to further increase the insurance coverage and to improve the care provided to young people. In 2011. the Minestry of Health therefore ordered the scale up of the Youth Friendly Health Services . This project is implementing this strategy. by ensuring quality. sustainability and accessibility (especially for vulnerable adolescents) of Youth Friendly Health Services.,youth friendly health services in moldova in moldova young people face various health challenges which are currently not adequately addressed by health services to improve this situation youth friendly health services started as pilots in and are being scaledup by the ministry of health since with the support of sdc the project is focused on improving the quality and enhancing the comprehensiveness of the services as well as on the community support for young people to adopt a healthier lifestyle and seek assistance from health services young people make up nearly a quarter of the total population in moldova they face various health issues such as sexual and reproductive problems substance abuse mental health disorders and suicide the moldovan health system did not yet completely overcome the legacy of the soviet times which focused solely on disease control while disregarding the needs of specific target groups in a radical public health reform has been launched however so far it remains partial with a need to further increase the insurance coverage and to improve the care provided to young people in the minestry of health therefore ordered the scale up of the youth friendly health services this project is implementing this strategy by ensuring quality sustainability and accessibility especially for vulnerable adolescents of youth friendly health services,Regarding the health system. the primary target groups are the public health authorities at national and district level. as well as the health professionals working in YFHS. The secondary target groups are: i) community stakeholders including 500 resource teams of 2-3 persons (one team per school) and ii) parents/ care-takers of adolescents.To reach a maximum of young people and especially the vulnerable ones. the project works also with youth volunteers. professional associations and NGOs working with young people and/or vulnerable groups and the mass media. Furthermore. with its focus on inter-sectorial cooperation. stakeholders in all relevant sectors (health. education. social. law enforcement. etc.) are targeted as well.Project beneficiaries:   all young people aged 10 to 24 years (especially those vulnerable and most at risk; young couples with or without children). ,In the first phase. 38 Youth Friendly Health Centers (YFHCs) have been set up. covering the entire country. except Transnistrian region. In 2014. all the YFHCs have been contracted by the National Health Insurance Company and the public funding for YFHS increased by 40%. The legal and regulatory framework for YFHS has been partially revised. Health care providers and community steakholders in 16 districts (half of the total number of districts in the country) received training; those from the remaining districts will be trained within the second phase. Important progress has been made towards including adolescent health care issues in the medical university curriculum. As a result of all these developments. the number of young people accessing YFHS almost quadrupled (from 5% in 2009 to about 20% in 2013). which also had measurable positive impact on the reduction of the sexually transmitted infections incidence among adolescents aged 15-19 years.To maintain and deepen these progresses. there is a continous need to advocate with national authorities for their further commitment to ensure a sustainable and functional system of comprehensive YFHS. with adequate financing; as well as to increase the support of local initiatives. Inter-sectorial cooperation should also be developed and institutionalized. ,Young men and women have equitable access to quality reproductive health servicesThe promotion of adolescent and youth health and the identification and referral of young people to YFHS is improved. through a stronger engagement of relevant stakeholders. at national and local level. in inter-sectorial cooperationYoung men and women adopt safer and healthier behaviors and seek necessary medical assistance. through a greater encouragement from community stakeholders ,Over the next three years the following numbers will be achieved:38 YFHC will be functional and covering the whole country with YFHS250000 adolescents will benefit from YFHS per year3000 general health professionals. 2000 community resource persons and 200 YFHC professionals will be trained,The project contributes to the improvement of the health of young men and women in Moldova. through increasing the demand. accessibility and utilization of quality youth friendly services and health-related education programmes.The overall goal is that young people (particularly those vulnerable and most at risk) adopt safer behaviours and seek assistance from health services when needed. ,,,,,2014,31.10.2018 00:00,4755000,3789432.12,,,,[agency:sdc],[aidtype:projectprogrammecontribution],[partnercontract:non-profitorgofsoutheast. partnercontract:privatesectorforeignnorth. partnercontract:unicef],,[partnercontracttype:ngo-international-foreign. partnercontracttype:privatesector. partnercontracttype:unitednationsorganizationsuno],,[],SCO Chisinau.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Activate,02.05.2017 17:31,celestine.descombes@eda.admin.ch,Activate,22.05.2014 14:03,admin,,Moldova,1,Mitigation,7F-07563,7F-07563.02,3.789432,0.0,0.0,Moldova

Due to chronic food shortage and the partly inability of the government to deliver full food rations. SLUGs began to cultivate sloping lands. The increasing tendency of cultivation on slope land in the 90s. led to deforestation and land degradation. The land degradation and natural risks caused by unsuitable sloping land cultivation was recognized by the Ministry of Land and Environmental Protection (MoLEP). in response MoLEP initiated a long term campaign of reforestation on these deforested sloping lands.,sloping land management starting in the ministry of land and environmental protection molep in partnership with sdc introduced to sloping land user groups slugs new sloping land management approaches and practices slm such as participatory land use planning reforestation conservation farming and environmental measurements with the aim to improve the livelihoods of the rural population dpr korea is covered by of mountainous and upland slopes and only of arable land due to chronic food shortage and the partly inability of the government to deliver full food rations slugs began to cultivate sloping lands the increasing tendency of cultivation on slope land in the s led to deforestation and land degradation the land degradation and natural risks caused by unsuitable sloping land cultivation was recognized by the ministry of land and environmental protection molep in response molep initiated a long term campaign of reforestation on these deforested sloping lands,The Sloping Land User Group (SLUG) is composed of 8-10 members. in majority housewives and pensioners living in the area. In the period 2013-2014 the total# of UG having access to improved AF cultivation information will double to number of 190 composed of 8-10 members (1700 peoples) The total number of UG will cultivate almost 2000 ha based on the by MoLEP disseminated AF techniques The activities will take place in 11 counties and two provinces (North Hwangwae. South Hamgyong).,Through the program implementation over the last 9 years. Agro Forestry (AF) practices were proven and confirmed as successful in preventing soil erosion and runoff. as well as sustainable farming production for SLUGs. At institutional level the training of MoLEP staff permitted a reinforcement of capacities for watershed management and disaster risk reduction techniques. The key results are: # User group. area: 93 SLUGs in 8 counties. 901 ha cultivated slopping land # Beneficiaries. gender: approx. 3'200 whereof more than 80% of UG members are women Crop diversity: increased from 1-2. potato and maize. to almost 15 crops for daily consumption and trade Environmental protection: grass belts of 1m width along the contour line. resulting 250km length; reducing soil loss by 60- 70% on slopping lands. Reforestation: 448ha with valuable tree species. Capacity building of SLUGs: 10-12 field training per year. Cross visit among SLUGs 3-4 times per year. Capacity building central and county level: 10 overseas study tours. involving around 100 staff and experts. Long term training (1 year) for 13 researchers in Kunming Institute of Botany. Publications: consolidation of 9 good SLM practices. Several manuals and leaflets on agro forestry were developed and disseminated to SLUGs. and Agricultural universities and colleges. Publication of a bilingual (Kr-En) manual on participatory AF development. Policy: 3 National Workshops on Agro forestry were organized. in 2008. 2009. 2011,SLM techniques are widely applied at policy level and in supported counties.Based on SLM /AF the food security for targeted population in selected areas is improved. the diversification of crop and tree species is achieved.Reforestation and appropriate protective measures against soil and environment degradation are an integral part of the SLM. ,,SLM is to ensure environmental sustainability. to improve food security and income generation for Sloping Land User Groups. The goal of the program is in line with UN MDG 1 and 7 SLM contributes to ecologically sustainable. economically viable and socially beneficial management of sloping land by improving soil fertility. preventing soil erosion and meeting the needs of local communities. MoLEP in its strategy 2011 -2015 is targeting 150'000 ha of degraded sloping lands to be restored on the basis of improved Agro-Forestry (AF) approach and reinforcing standards mainly based on the experiences of MoLEP/SDC SLM projects.

Lao PDR has experienced unprecedented growth in foreign direct investmentsparticularly in the mining. hydropower. and agribusiness industriesand has successfully reduced the national poverty rate by nearly two percentage points per year. However. despite impressive growth. many young Lao people cannot find gainful employment.The growth of the natural resources-based sectors. such as hydropower and mining. has failed to create many new jobs for Lao people. About seventy percent of the Lao population still relies on agriculture for food and income. and the country faces a major challenge to diversify its economy and create jobs in the industry and services sectors.Employers in Lao PDR report a lack of skilled labor and a mismatch between the supply of human resources and the demands of the labor market. More than 100.000 foreign. highly skilled workers have migrated into Lao PDR. while an estimated 300.000 Laotians have migrated abroad to find jobs that require fewer skills. Labor migrationand therefore competition over jobsis expected to increase once the ASEAN Community enters into force in 2015. opening the countrys borders to a free flow of goods. services. capital. and skilled workers.The Lao government has formulated a new law on vocational education to ensure that the national education offers match the demands of the labor market.

Thanks to the program 4.500 producer families will increase their net annual income by at least 10%. while 4.000 young adults and 2.000 women gain access to sustainable jobs. This will boost the local economy in the poor and peripheral areas in which cocoa is grown.   ,Central America has optimal agro-ecological conditions for the production of fine cocoa. An expansion of the agroforestry systems which grow cocoa is currently underway. The cocoa chain can rely on a relatively safe market. due to a steady increase in world demand over the last years.As much as 97% of the cocoa in Honduras and Nicaragua. the two main focus countries of this regional intervention. is produced by small farmers with scarce economic resources. Families earn an income not only from the production of cocoa beans. but also from their agroforestry systems (plantains. timber trees). which enhances their economic resilience.The small farmers are organized in cooperatives and solidary groups and have though increased access to acceptable cocoa fermentation. drying and storage facilities.However there are still weaknesses in the value chain regarding productivity. competitiveness. business diversification. product quantity and quality. the use of technologies and entrepreneurial organization.

This allowed producers to improve their quality of life and invest in expanding their cocoa parcels.In Honduras a public-private partnership with Chocolat Halba has been established. The Switzerland based enterprise made substantial investments in infrastructure and committed itself to paying fair prices for Honduran cacao. The product of this collaboration can be bought in all Coop stores.With support from SDC. the financial sector has designed and implemented six financial products (micro-credits) so that small farmers and cooperatives can procure quality plants and invest in infrastructure for the post-harvest process of fermentation and drying of the cocoa beans.In Nicaragua the cocoa bean harvest in the area of intervention went from 90 metric tons MT in 2016 to 152 MT in 2017 (40%).The dialogue between the government and the private sector led to the establishment of a value chain committee which brings together all the important actors of the cocoa value chain and which represents 22 cooperatives and 3.700 small cocoa producers.  At regional level support has been provided to the establishment of cocoa platforms for public-private dialogue in Guatemala.

7F08757,1,1,Hydro-energy,MRLG. Phase 1,Mekong Region Land Governance (MRLG),The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) has been supporting the Mekong Region Land Governance (MRLG) project in Cambodia. Lao PDR. Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV) since April 2014.  ,Since around 2000. governments in the Mekong Region began granting large-scale and long-term land concessions of agricultural and forest land to international and domestic investors. mostly for industrial agriculture. logging. mining. and hydropower. This has resulted in a significant shrinking of the area available for family agriculture and community forestry. and reduced access to natural resources that used to contribute to food security. The situation for family farmers is made even more difficult by the loss of land tenure and use rights. environmental degradation. resettlement. and limited prospects of finding alternative employment.The various stakeholders and their competing interests make land governance a highly sensitive and politically important topic that is at the very center of development challenges in the Mekong region.The people to land relationship in the Mekong region is such that land is seen as more than just the basis for livelihood. It is also essential for peoples social and cultural identity and even their sense of self-worth. Ultimately. the good governance of land is a precondition for social harmony and political stability.,mekong region land governance mrlg the swiss agency for development and cooperation sdc has been supporting the mekong region land governance mrlg project in cambodia lao pdr myanmar and vietnam clmv since april since around governments in the mekong region began granting largescale and longterm land concessions of agricultural and forest land to international and domestic investors mostly for industrial agriculture logging mining and hydropower this has resulted in a significant shrinking of the area available for family agriculture and community forestry and reduced access to natural resources that used to contribute to food security the situation for family farmers is made even more difficult by the loss of land tenure and use rights environmental degradation resettlement and limited prospects of finding alternative employmentthe various stakeholders and their competing interests make land governance a highly sensitive and politically important topic that is at the very center of development challenges in the mekong regionthe people to land relationship in the mekong region is such that land is seen as more than just the basis for livelihood it is also essential for peoples social and cultural identity and even their sense of selfworth ultimately the good governance of land is a precondition for social harmony and political stability,The direct beneficiaries are the actors of land reform in the Mekong region. whose effectiveness is strengthened by the project work. They are recorded at the beginning of the project (Reform Actor Mapping). The indirect beneficiaries include the decision-makers responsible for land law and other stakeholders involved. whose perceptions and actions are increasingly influenced by the reform actors. However. the project is fundamentally aimed at farming families in the Mekong countries (around 70% of the population of Cambodia. Laos and Myanmar and 60% of the population of Vietnam. a total of more than 100 million people). The two funds are primarily aimed at ethnic minorities and women in order to ensure their access to land.,The impact in brief: Reform actors in the Mekong countries can more effectively advocate for land access for smallholder farmers and help ensure that land governance policies. institutions and practices are more conducive to land access for farming families and the associated public goods such as environmental sustainability and social stability. ,The results in brief: Reform actors in the Mekong countries can more effectively promote land access for smallholder farmers and help ensure that land governance policies. institutions and practices increasingly promote land access for farming families and the associated public goods such as ecological sustainability and social stability.,The MLRG Innovation Fund (IF) provides medium term funding allowing reform actors to pilot improved tenure policy and practices. e.g. based on knowledge acquired through the learning activities.The 1st and 2nd Calls for Proposals were met with an exceptional response on both occasions in May 2015 and 2016. Up to 25 projects are expected to be funded from November 2015 onwards. across all four CLMV countries.The project design provides flexibility for partnership and alliance with other donors. Thus Germany joined with financial and technical contributions as per since May 2015. and the government of Luxembourg joins in September 2016 as a co-donor.The project has created a substantial level of awareness among a wide variety of  stakeholders in the region and within a short period of time. and is expected to gain further momentum over the next years.,The projects overall goal is to contribute to family farmers in the Mekong region to have more secure tenure (ownership and access) over land. by:strengthening the effectiveness of a wide range of stakeholders to participate in land-related reform processes. through learning and regional cooperation.supporting the emergence of more favorable policies and practices.To reach these goals the project:makes available reliable information and analyses on land tenure and good practices to the stakeholders working in this area.supports specific projects and initiatives. for example ongoing government policy processes or learning processes. through three facilities: learning and alliance building. the Quick Disbursement Fund and the Innovation Fund.supports the establishment of regional networks for capacity development. cross-border learning and multi-stakeholder cooperation.,,,,,2013,31.12.2018 00:00,13350000,13143166.16,,,,[agency:sdc],[aidtype:mandatewithfiduciaryfunds],[partnercontract:nationalstateinstnorth. partnercontract:non-profitorgofsoutheast],LEI (Land Equity International) & GRET (Professionals for Fair Development),[partnercontracttype:ngo-international-foreign. partnercontracttype:stateinstitutionsforeign],,[],SCO Vientiane.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Activate,08.10.2019 10:46,reference-adjustment-service,Activate,08.10.2019 10:46,reference-adjustment-service,,Mekong,11,Mitigation,7F-08757,7F-08757.01,13.143167,0.0,0.0,"Far East Asia, regional"

7F08988,1,1,Adaptation,(*)OSCE Chairmanship 2014/2015,Swiss OSCE Chairmanship 2014 - Promoting Disaster Risks Management through Capacity Building,Federal Council Didier Burkhalter defined ten priorities for the Swiss OSCE Chairmanship in 2014. One priority is related to a more reliable management of natural disasters. This priority has a strong link to reducing disaster risks through mitigation. prevention and preparedness by key stakeholders at different governmental and non-governmental levels (=integrated disaster risk management). It is of utmost security relevance for the OSCE region. as natural hazard triggered disasters/accidents know no boundaries. As this topic has never extensively been addressed in the OSCE. the focus of SDC action lines during the Swiss Chairmanship will be on capacity building among the 57 participating States in disaster risk management and on cooperation in that field. SDC considers the Swiss Chairmanship as a window of opportunity to engage the relevant stakeholders (practitioners and governmental representatives) in promoting disaster resilience for the upcoming global post-2015 processes (revisited DRR framework; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)).  ,The East-West tensions are still tangible in the OSCE. Because of the non-conflictive nature of the priority more reliable management of natural disasters. it will assumingly encounter - in comparison to other Swiss priorities - less controversy among OSCE participating States. The topic of natural hazard triggered disasters/accidents is of utmost security relevance for the OSCE region. However. it has never received much attention.

The intervention proposes an innovative approach to integrated watershed management that will sustainably increase the resilience of local populations. while improving their living conditions. Morocco&#39;s strong commitment to its future replication at the national level allows for a considerable multiplier effect.  , Soil erosion. a key factor in natural disaster risk management. affects 90% of Morocco. 3 million hectares require rapid intervention. particularly in the Atlas Mountains. The mountainous region of Midelt in the Middle Atlas consists of 4 watersheds. Populated by more than 80.000 people. the area is particularly affected by erosion and desertification. Aggravated by the effects of climate change. the precariousness of the local nomadic and sedentary population is directly linked to soil degradation with recurring downstream flooding. a decrease in wood production. biodiversity. pastures. and the productivity of irrigated land. Thus. the urban center of Midelt located downstream suffered heavy flooding in 1992 and 2008. 50% of the population lives below the poverty line. i.e. less than MAD 10 /person/ day and the rural exodus is intensifying. The accelerated rate of degradation of natural resources and significant social dynamism make the region a priority for the Moroccan government. The preservation of forest and pasture lands is the responsibility of the High Commission for Water. Forests and the Fight against Desertification (HCEFLCD). an agency reporting directly to the head of government. Despite policies and programs aimed at combating erosion. natural resource management remains sectoral and participatory approaches are lacking. This leads to a lack of efficiency and complementarity in the actions undertaken. Faced with these challenges. the HCEFLCD has made a request for support for the establishment of an integrated watershed management system. a first in Morocco and a path towards sustainable resource management. ,integrated watershed management in the middle atlas soil erosion in morocco severe in the atlas mountains is both a cause and an indicator of the challenges facing vulnerable populations in the region natural disasters and precariousness the intervention proposes an innovative approach to integrated watershed management that will sustainably increase the resilience of local populations while improving their living conditions moroccos strong commitment to its future replication at the national level allows for a considerable multiplier effect soil erosion a key factor in natural disaster risk management affects of morocco million hectares require rapid intervention particularly in the atlas mountains the mountainous region of midelt in the middle atlas consists of watersheds populated by more than people the area is particularly affected by erosion and desertification aggravated by the effects of climate change the precariousness of the local nomadic and sedentary population is directly linked to soil degradation with recurring downstream flooding a decrease in wood production biodiversity pastures and the productivity of irrigated land thus the urban center of midelt located downstream suffered heavy flooding in and of the population lives below the poverty line ie less than mad person day and the rural exodus is intensifying the accelerated rate of degradation of natural resources and significant social dynamism make the region a priority for the moroccan government the preservation of forest and pasture lands is the responsibility of the high commission for water forests and the fight against desertification hceflcd an agency reporting directly to the head of government despite policies and programs aimed at combating erosion natural resource management remains sectoral and participatory approaches are lacking this leads to a lack of efficiency and complementarity in the actions undertaken faced with these challenges the hceflcd has made a request for support for the establishment of an integrated watershed management system a first in morocco and a path towards sustainable resource management,Direct beneficiaries: The intervention covers 4 watersheds over an area of 166.670 ha. The target groups are the sedentary. nomadic and semi-nomadic populations of the intervention area (approximately 36.700 inhabitants). as well as local/regional entities and technical services responsible for the development of the territory. Particular attention will be given to the most vulnerable groups (young people. women farm managers. landless farmers. etc.). Indirect beneficiaries: The urban center of Midelt and its 46.000 inhabitants will benefit indirectly from a reduction in flood risks. The dissemination of the integrated management model at the national level will affect the whole of Morocco.,The proposal is based on targeted studies and some pilot projects financed by the small actions of the office. These confirm that soil degradation is still reversible and establish baselines to measure future results. It also shows that the potential for economic development linked to improved watershed management is substantial and will allow for very concrete synergies to be achieved with the support program for professional associations and that on the rosemary value chain.,A reproducible model of participatory and integrated watershed management capable of reducing the risks of natural disasters and usable for the orientation of action plans. including the application of innovative techniques. the modalities of organization of local communities and intersectoral partnerships for the integration and synergy of territorial development actions.,An integrated and participatory model approach to watershed management is developed. tested and refinedLand productivity is improved and degradation and flood risk are reducedThe development of promising sectors and innovative income-generating activities is promoted in the watersheds covered by the projectGood practices and lessons learned are capitalized on. disseminated and shared. including within the framework of South-South Cooperation,Through the participatory development of pilot activities to combat erosion and rehabilitate soils and forests. prepare the scaling up by the Moroccan government of integrated watershed management plans aimed at simultaneously ensuring economic development and reducing the vulnerability of their populations.,AGIRE Water Management.

Changes in behaviour and consumption require empathy. Art is a complementary pathway helping to create awareness. stimulate necessary debate and generate action. By engaging artists with society at large. with a particular focus on mountains as entry point and on youth as important actor group. the implementation of Agenda 2030 can be enhanced.,While factual knowledge and information regarding key global challenges are widely available. behaviour and consumption patterns remain on an unsustainable path.In order to trigger the necessary changes. other entry points need to be explored to complement the traditional fact based and rather abstract rationales that are difficult to be understood by many actors of the society. Herein art and culture - combined with inter-cultural exchanges and encounters - can make a meaningful contribution to help implement and achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other global agendas such as the Paris Agreement or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.Relevance of intervention:   Art and culture have proven to be powerful agents of change when it comes to raising awareness about complex processes and abstract challenges such as the concept of Sustainable Development (SD).Herein the project Sustainable Mountain Art (SMArt) attempts to sensitize various target groups both in Switzerland and in the countries of origin of the involved artists for global issues including in particular those related to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other relevant and related global agendas.By providing the opportunity to a number of artists to spend time in a different context  in particular the Swiss mountains  new perspectives and new contextual understandings are stimulated.

With several ongoing Swiss Cooperation strategies incorporating aspects of DRR. SDC/HA decided to strengthen its DRR and rapid response capacities in this region. Since April 2013. a Regional Disaster Risk Reduction &amp; Rapid Response (RR) Advisor is based in Bangkok. which is the regional hub in terms of DRR and logistically ideally placed for a stand-by presence for rapid response in the region. With evolution of the program and tasks. the Advisor is being supported by an additional Regional DRR Advisor since January 2015. The team is tasked with (1) supporting SDCs programs in DRR mainstreaming and implementing targeted DRR projects. (2) supporting Swiss Cooperation Offices and Embassies in the field of rapid response and (3) reinforce policy dialogue and networking with key humanitarian actors in the region. The current proposal includes the costs for the Advisors as well as for programmatic activities within the frame of the mandate.   ,The Asia-Pacific is the worlds most hazard-prone region with high exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards and the impact of climate change. which threaten the sustainability of humanitarian and development results.As Switzerland is implementing both humanitarian and development activities in the region. SDC HA decided in 2013 to strengthen its DRR capacities in the region to support SDC Offices in ensuring projects and programs implemented are disaster-proof and take into account the impact of climate change.With Bangkok representing the regional multilateral hub. including in terms of DRR. the assignment of a thematic advisor attached to the Swiss Embassy in Bangkok. with regional stand by capacities in case of emergencies. has proven to be the most adequate option to respond to the regional strategic. thematic and institutional needs.Given the increasing work load. the SDC HA Europe. Asia and Americas (EAA) division decided to reinforce the Regional DRR &amp; Rapid Response Advisors capacities by deploying in addition a junior Regional DRR Advisor for a one year assignment starting from January 2015.
